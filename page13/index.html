	<h1><a href="/10-17-2014/friday-faves.html">Friday Favessss.</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		October 17, 2014
	</div>

	<p>My mailbox has had a pretty awesome week of packages, and so I wanted to share all the great things I got this week.</p>

<p>My team at work just launched, and so to celebrate we got t-shirts (and also went out for beers and appetizers.). Usually, shirts from work are the type of thing you only ever want to wear to sleep, or work out in. This one actually looks kind of okay (if you disregard the serious duck face I’m giving. Haha.)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7nCyC0pfUJ8/VEG80m0NoCI/AAAAAAAAL-o/FgfKRu6LAYY/w537-h716-no/IMG_3903.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>I am an addict for subscriptions, and one of the lesser known ones I love is <a href="http://footcardigan.com/">Foot Cardigan</a>. They send you an adorable pair of socks monthly. Both J and I have a subscription, and they’re awesome because, who doesn’t wear socks? Granted, few people see them except when I’ve got my pants cuffed to bike to work.</p>

<p>This month’s festive pair is so adorable though. ;)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/nBAuTLZjZ6GfkDFcivjSZCnIpj9KdQEBJL0OOyrkTp8=w955-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>I buy waaaaay too many cards. While I keep pretty light on spending usually, I am basically a card hoarder. Fortunately, it comes in handy when you find out you’re going to a birthday with only a few days notice. This one is super adorable and kitschy. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-YgTuE4yHgWw/VEHaHV3thKI/AAAAAAAAL_U/bX2TQQ9P_Og/w537-h716-no/IMG_3912.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Last, but not least. Shoes! </p>

<p>When I was in first grade and a student wore new shoes to class, the teacher would let you stand on your desk, and then almost as if singing happy birthday, or saying the pledge, all the other students would say in tandem “Ooooh, ahhhh, neeeew, shoooes.” It was a great way to start a healthy shoe addiction young.</p>

<p>These are the VivoBarefoot ones. The boyfriend has been super into minimalist traveling, and so he convinced me into trying a pair of barefoot shoes. They’re incredibly light, and only have a 4 mm base, which makes me less of a giant. I’m pretty addicted to my Mizunos, but I’ll be giving these a try this week. It&#39;s definitely a different feel from cushy shoes.</p>

	<h1><a href="/10-16-2014/woah-fall.html">Woooah, it's fall.</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		October 16, 2014
	</div>

	<p>Up until today, my life still felt like summer. California has been bright, sunny, and warm. I had yet to bundle up in anything more than a t-shirt. Heck, even the trees were still bright green.</p>

<p>But today, that all changed! Now, it’s unquestionably fall. And it all began with a pumpkin.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-zyYtyfJV3M0/VECHHx2RjqI/AAAAAAAAL4o/jKQ34uBCFcE/s716-no/IMG_3896.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>A 1600 pound pumpkin for that matter. Someone had delivered it to the office, and it was as tall as me (and I’m 5’10”.) And just… giant. All I could think of is how many muffins, scones, and spice lattes you could make with that sucker. Delicious.</p>

<p>Then, at lunch, I got roped into (read: I totally volunteered for) making decorations for my company’s Halloween party. It’s Alice in Wonderland themed (isn’t that the best? Spooky and whimsical without being cliche). So today I helped fold some of 800 paper roses.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-e0VbHCYZ4pU/VECHK6cMIyI/AAAAAAAAL7A/h9EWMwH_OWY/w955-h716-no/IMG_3894.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ZF2V5EM3i-8/VECHMOCKi6I/AAAAAAAAL60/68CytVOVMYg/w756-h716-no/IMG_3895.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Folding was a nice break from my typical daily work. The directions were super easy, and surprisingly, despite a bunch of us all working at once, the flowers turned out great. <a href="http://pldevents.com/how-to-paper-flowers/">This</a> is basically exactly what we did. Everyone at the table kept remarking that it felt like they were crafting for their wedding all over again, and how much they missed the DIY aspect of planning for it. By lunch end, we had knocked out about 100. The Queen’s maze is going to look great.</p>

<p>Decorating for Halloween and giant pumpkins started getting me in the fall mood. But then I walked into yoga tonight, and the class door was open to the outside, and it was freezing. Finally the temperature was telling me something. It’s fall.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-EZoSRD1DDwo/VECHNSPdIFI/AAAAAAAAL6k/43k4kG1bioA/w999-h716-no/IMG_3897.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>We closed the door and got to class. This yoga is called “Creative Yoga and Flow”, and it&#39;s the first yoga class I ever took. The first time I took from this instructor, when she was fixing my form, she gasped and cried out (to the entired class) “You need yoga! Your muscles are so tight. You work out too much with no yoga.” While simultaneously flattering (I work out!) and embarrassing (omg did everyone hear that), her class has been great for me to deepen my stretches in the basic poses. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-_bgZZCOtseE/VECHQI9fotI/AAAAAAAAL6s/_KwG6uo6btk/w906-h716-no/IMG_3899.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>As you can see, I’m ready with my mat, block and strap, well before the class starts. I can’t lie, I like to be on time. But my biggest pet peeve, is people who walk in late. 5-10 minutes late? Totally fine. 30-45 minutes late in an hour and fifteen minute class. Ridiculous. By that point, I’m in the middle of class, holding a pose, and the student who just walked in is asking me to move. Totally throws me off. </p>

<p>How’s your day been? Feeling fall? And what’s your biggest pet peeve?</p>

	<h1><a href="/10-15-2014/hawaii-end.html">Hawaii Day 6 - The end of Hawaii :(</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		October 15, 2014
	</div>

	<p>On the Big Island, we stayed in the cutest B&amp;B right outside Volcanoes National Park. Bamboo Orchid Cottage is basically a giant house buried in the middle of (what feels like) the rainforest. The owner is fantastically fun, and takes great care of the place, when we came in after hiking, the fireplace was lit, a soothing CD was on, and the room smelled amazing. </p>

<p>But my favorite part was the breakfast:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/tNAA6yV3qOsxM6g69jd01eCI6kOJrwSlnqU3OxhtkZA=w845-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>The owner made us all lobster shaped papaya boats! The fruit on Hawaii was so fresh that I could have eaten two of these every morning. So delicious. My other favorite (and one of the only things I bought in Hawaii) was this adorable running shirt.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/D5jpeMh3ztJPMks3VI0dszMP2Eng2_wQ101seD9I8lM=w537-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>The store was so cute, and when we walked by I had to run in and have it. Had to. I can’t wait to do a race in this sucker.</p>

<p>We spent some time hiking Akaka Falls, hiking is a strong word as it’s just a tiny loop. But unlike in Maui, the falls here had water! It was a beautiful destination, but be warned, they make you pay to enter, even if you don’t park in their lot.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-9-OrUfrB19o/VB9JRklLUkI/AAAAAAAAJkU/6BGtZ7pmXRw/w537-h716-no/IMG_3665.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>J and I hit up some other scenic points. They were nice, but I was tired, and not feeling so well. Fortunately, J took picture duty.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Thf3Fx1KeTs/VB9KAKcFcPI/AAAAAAAAJpI/VrBkFNSz3gw/w955-h716-no/IMG_3691.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>We flew back to Maui, since we were departing from there, and checked into our hotel. I was only feeling worse, so we ordered room service. It was my first room service ever. I took a picture, even if I didn’t really eat any of it. :/</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-L0gQwEkZRFk/VB9KHcqc6RI/AAAAAAAAL4A/nfZ3Xn7Tf5c/w955-h716-no/IMG_3696.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Still feeling ill the next morning, I sent J out to our snorkel reservation. I was bummed I missed it, but his pictures are too amazing not to post.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-C5ZA5-W-bGg/VB-pn-hEewI/AAAAAAAALbU/-Kc0N2h_T-A/w1038-h688-no/turtle-head.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>We flew home that evening. It was an amazing trip, and we really got to enjoy good weather, and no internet connection (a lovely break from the all the time internet connection we have). J and I definitely hope to go back seeing as we’re closer to Hawaii than NYC now. :)</p>

	<h1><a href="/10-14-2014/volcanos.html">Hawaii Day 5 - Volcanoes!</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		October 14, 2014
	</div>

	<p>After a few days in Maui, we decided to hop on over to the Big Island. While there were lava reports on the radio, we didn’t see any active lava. We didn’t think it would be in good spirits to tour on someone else’s devastation. So instead we spent a lot of time at Volcanoes National Park exploring previous eruption sites.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-FI4O0ZC6V_0/VB9vWUX-wHI/AAAAAAAAJyo/IRAWmfKDdoY/w1038-h692-no/IMG_1168.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>We woke up early the morning after our flight to head over to the park. We wanted to start the day by stretching our legs, so, we hiked the Kīlauea Iki Trail to the Thurston lava tube. It’s a 6 mile hike into what was once a lake of lava. Having since dried out, the crater is a great place to explore volcanic scenery. Getting there early led to much more amazing pictures. By 10 am, tons of tourist buses had offloaded, filling the crater.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/8qeoFChDldhfzPzB3fzGqYFORHe0C4at18xwqGRa77U=w524-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>We learned a lot about what happens after a volcanic eruption, and getting to see the rocks and crags up close was great.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-WYWjWGiFGro/VB9vgECbLEI/AAAAAAAAJzI/rXAawJudE-M/w477-h716-no/IMG_1195.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>J was really into the learning aspect of the crater, and I was really into the making fun of J for learning so much about a crater aspect.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_sLeHtxIGEim-Vqw5G2xjIk1T1Zn36EIWOOrocTl40Q=w581-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Though it’s a kind of random picture, a few days before, I had caught a surfboard with my arm while surfing, and had developed a pretty serious bruise. I wanted to preserve it with a photo. Better my arm than my face, I guess. :)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/P6oRx7G0ZmDhOs2utVWKvX-H9khU3RxxzumJRHE1wN4=w979-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>We scaled out of the crater and into the lava tube, where bus, upon tour bus was parked. The tube is a great in and out jaunt, but it didn’t really offer much when compared to the crater. And the pictures inside made my inner photographer cry. With all the flash, poor lighting, and people everywhere, it didn’t lead to great pictures, or a great experience.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Zc_vJJbFJ7E/VB8vV6SO6tI/AAAAAAAAJOA/ro2vLORrjSE/w955-h716-no/IMG_3524.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>After, we drove the chain of craters road. The views were awesome, but the road was more hyped that we’d have liked. It’s a 20-30 mile road that stops where a lava flow crossed the road in 2003, blocking the path.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Gm7oRBZz8Z0/VB9vml2pFNI/AAAAAAAAJ0E/wfQUPLYJOEE/w1038-h692-no/IMG_1219.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>At the end of the day, we saw our first real lava sighting. We drove to the Jaggar Musuem to watch the lava out of the Halema&#39;uma&#39;u Crater. It was a really beautiful experience. We got in right before sundown, and stayed until sunset. </p>
