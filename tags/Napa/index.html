	<h1><a href="/1-22-2015/the-crash.html">The Crash</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		January 22, 2015
	</div>

	<p>On Monday, <a href="http://www.kaybueno.com/1-19-2015/MLK-day.html">I posted a sad photo of J from the emergency room</a>. This week, I’ve been in and out of urgent care, an emergency room, I’ve learned to splint toes, clean wounds, and how to nearly mummify someone in non-stick gauze.</p>

<p>But all of that pales in comparison to how the accident went down.</p>

<p>You see, J and I had plans to spend the weekend biking in Napa. Winter is the <a href="http://www.napavintners.com/harvest/life_cycle_of_a_grape.asp">pruning season</a> in Napa Valley, and so it means less tourists, cheaper hotels, and more open roads.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/JB4XVjDdXT7fWHAjDUd-tzYVws0QZWHdl7EA1quNka4R=w955-h716-no" alt=""><div class="caption">This is your boyfriend in Napa before he’s wrecked</div></p>

<p>We’ve done this route, or similar routes before. We planned for a 2 mile bike ride to the winery, and then about 25 more miles traversing the mountains nearby before we’d head back. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-f4UAxBTYovU/VL1oEb5NRqI/AAAAAAAAT_E/pcJd9aFMZKA/w794-h500-no/IMG_6207.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Though it took us awhile, we reached the top of the summit, and prepared for the fun part. Coasting downhill. J has always been more fearless than I am, so the rule is that he can go as fast as he wants, as long as he waits for me to catch up every so often. Yes, I am a baby who sometimes rides her brakes downhill.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Arg1sJDd-lI/VL1oS9w2ahI/AAAAAAAAUA8/Oy0VHiTGLDM/w955-h716-no/IMG_6217.JPG" alt="J biking"><div class="caption">We took some show-offy bike photos just minutes before eating it.</div></p>

<p>We started downhill, and after a few turns, I saw Jon waiting for me on the side of the road. I assumed he was just waiting for me to catch up, but as I got closer I noticed his bike handlebars were tangled around the frame, his face was pained, and his shirt had been completely shredded up and down the sides.</p>

<p>It turned out, he was taking the downhill at 40 mph, and didn&#39;t realize the next turn was so sharp. He started losing control, and grabbed the wrong brake, the rear brake, which made his bike fishtail. He thought he had control, but then he hit the gravel and went rolling. He told me, coincidentally, that right before he fell, he thought &quot;Wow, this is the most beautiful ride I&#39;ve ever done.&quot;</p>

<p>About a minute after the crash, a huge white SUV pulled up and asked if we were okay. He stopped for us and opened the trunk. It was full of boxes, first aid equipment, hazard clean up bags, knives, etc. I knew at this point we were either in really good hands. Or about to be murdered.</p>

<p>Turns out we were saved. The good Samaritan was a local Sheriff from the CSI division. He helped us clean up J, load our bikes into the car, and brought us to the ER. He had to duck out because he needed to get to a crime scene, but this guy pretty much saved us. If he hadn&#39;t stopped, I would have had to bike the remaining 12 miles to civilization and call an ambulance from there.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/rv4t9-sPGowcrBgexwJPczCxcFBTsqx95cOoxtRq4dnT=w955-h716-no" alt="J ER"></p>

<p>J got to the hospital, where he had many X-rays. Found out he broke his toe, and sprained his rib and shoulder. Received some serious pain killers, and was cleaned up even more. We made it out alive, and even got to eat BBQ after.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a cool story, and despite our accident, I definitely love, and want to continue biking in Napa. But for future hikes, bikes or just work outs, I think it&#39;s incredibly important to have an emergency plan. </p>

<p>There are about 100 ways this could have gone worse. If I was ahead of J. If no one stopped. If J hurt himself worse and needed immediate care. We didn&#39;t even have band-aids on us.</p>

<p>In the future, we&#39;ll definitely be carrying basic first aid supplies, I&#39;m making both of us take our phones, and we&#39;ll have to have a plan of action for getting lost.</p>

<p>What&#39;s the craziest thing that&#39;s happened to you lately? Do you have plans in case of emergencies?</p>
