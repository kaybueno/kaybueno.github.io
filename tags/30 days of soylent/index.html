	<p>I love the feeling of anticipation right up until I have to take the first step. During the morning, I dream about running, until I hit the moment where I need to lace up my shoes and take off. When I’m just ready to go, I hit that initial dread of the activity. What if it goes wrong? What if I hate it?</p>

<p>So it’s no surprise that now, the night before I embark on a primarily liquid diet, that I feel that ache in the pit of my stomach. Unboxing soylent. Beautiful. Showing the packaging off to my boyfriend, amazing. But as I go to eat my “last supper”, I feel uneasy. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-vbQMTypmDZw/U-TvStzUjUI/AAAAAAAAGzY/DDZ_OMWWWSc/w647-h716-no/IMG_2648.JPG" alt="My starter kit"></p>

<p>I received my shipment of soylent last week. And because I’d like to pretend my life demands fanfare, I refused to begin a liquid diet on a Thursday, because as any yo-yo dieter knows, diets must begin on a Monday, to give you the entire weekend to binge and feel bad about your choices.</p>

<p>Soylent comes in a ~2000 calorie pack, and advertises ideal nutrition. As I’m a woman, and relatively sedentary, I plan on experimenting with my calorie intake until I find a good medium. Ideally somewhere between 1000-1500, depending on my activity levels.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-jmBYPGGJJ-o/U-TvekpiidI/AAAAAAAAG1E/bbXrywTLfqA/w850-h716-no/IMG_2657.JPG" alt="One ‘day’ of Soylent"></p>

<p>All this said, I’m still a social person, and I plan on eating normal food over the weekends so my boyfriend isn’t driven insane by my food experimenting, and hopefully so I can’t ruin my digestive system (and other body systems?) too much.</p>

<p>At least I have until tomorrow.</p>

	<p>Before I tried Soylent, I read about it everywhere. As much as I could. But reading about it was unfulfilling because all of the descriptions are so bland… so neutral…</p>

<p>But I get it now! When I got home, it was almost easier to describe what Soylent wasn’t, than what it was. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-6mLCc2lqXWo/U-mSipjQmTI/AAAAAAAAG78/nEnEh1WTcLA/w955-h716-no/IMG_2689.JPG" alt="Measuring my day of food"></p>

<p>Like, you know how when you eat food, and it’s your favorite food. The way you eat is happy, the act of consuming is an exciting moment. And you&#39;re like super happy. In your eating. It’s a good food experience.</p>

<p>But like, you can also have really bad food experiences. You can eat something gross, or something you’re not in the mood for, and you honestly don’t want another bite. It’s a negative food experience.</p>

<p>Soylent is neither of these. I found myself taking sips to keep myself from getting hungry (something I quickly noticed if I got too focused in my work and forgot to drink). But I was neither repulsed or excited to eat more. It’s pretty late at night and I’m only a little more than 2/3rds of the way through 1000 calories of Soylent. But I just sip at it every 20-30 minutes or so.</p>

<p>I did eat real food today though to ease in. Two apples. One first thing in the morning, and one at 5 pm. I want to make sure my digestive tract doesn’t freak out on me. </p>

<p>Overall it went, well. No reason to be nervous. Granted, everything is easiest the first day. Everything but posting these pictures!</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-anY_c5mfPPw/U-mW0P0Z0DI/AAAAAAAAG8M/BWOnKWwdhCE/w922-h532-no/kittstart.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>I hate putting these late night “Before” pictures up, but I want to track my progress and see how soylent affects my overall body. So pardon the awkward photos we snapped at midnight last night. But hopefully, these not so sexy shots will lead to some great afters. :)</p>

<p>Total today ~1240 calories</p>

	<p>I&#39;ve been making my daily batch of Soylent the night before. I’ve heard letting sit, makes the liquid less gritty, and also, it gives me more time in the morning to get ready. I’m lazy, so I just measure, blend, and then shove the entire blender in the fridge for the night. (minus the base, guys, I’m not an idiot.)</p>

<p>Doing this means I can wake up, re-blend for a second to reintegrate the oils that have separated (delicious) and go.</p>

<p>Sorry in advance for all the selfies. After yesterdays photos, I needed a lot of make up and good angles in today&#39;s post. :)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/CBPIJcl_0fF156E36fX72nMsovGURT9_nj8CHpo-Wb4=w715-h716-no" alt="Kay plus blender"></p>

<p>Day two was as easy, or easier than day one. I actually have a hard time finishing all the soylent by the end of the day. I need to drink more in the morning, because before Soylent, I most naturally ate the most during the day.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/X7WEWJiQj3U3FK0prUDv7JoAQ5CWblBWoAbV4EnI2bs=w903-h716-no" alt="soylent in blender bottle"> </p>

<p>So far, no one in person has noticed or asked me about my kind of bizarre eating habits, which is really relieving, because honestly, I don&#39;t really want to explain. My suggestion for keeping it under wraps? I&#39;ve been able to fit it all in a blender bottle, which you can see in basically every picture. So it&#39;s pretty small and inconspicuous. </p>

<p>But, I&#39;m still worried, I can&#39;t avoid lunch with the coworkers forever. Lately, I&#39;ve been hoping to do non-eating activities during my normal lunch break. I figure walking, and yoga can replace my usual munching. Unfortunately, the last two lunches, I’ve just been doing work at my desk. Uggggh.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-u2nb_4jLKjk/U-pS_OfZHMI/AAAAAAAAHAk/4ZrTT4QX3gg/s716-no/IMG_2705-MIX.jpg" alt="Quad selfies"> </p>

<p>Overall though, I feel even, and happy not making choices. The last two days have been fairly stressful, and usually that would mean I’d be chomping my way through snacks and coffee at work. But I haven’t. I mean, I still drink coffee, tea, and other nearly 0 calorie beverages. But I’m not trying to binge my stress away.</p>

<p>It&#39;s silly but, I want magical results at day two, so then I’d feel like I have something great to tell you, or to write about. So far, I haven’t exercised heavily since drinking soylent, but I’m hoping to do a good run tomorrow and see how it goes!</p>

	<p>I almost cried over two out of three of those today.</p>

<p>I’ll fill you in. I have a huge crush on Jonathan Adler. I don’t even know what he looks like, or if he’s a good person. But I love his designs. So when he came out with a cheaper department store line, I bought a ton up. </p>

<p>Unfortunately I had to ship it to my new apartment, and in the process, one of my favorite pieces, an elephant lamp shattered. :( I’ve been super glue-ing him back together, but I’ve had to glue so much, I ran out. Here he is in a mostly fixed state. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-DkiXGQnn_L0/U-uOF9toaII/AAAAAAAAHCc/JmSyqfB2evk/w837-h716-no/IMG_2724.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Then today, on the way to work, I got a flat tire on my bike. Which seemed okay, because I had a tube and pump at work. So I worked at replacing the tube (I’m a total bike fixing novice, this took me basically forever), after many attempts to pump my bike, I found out the needle was broken, so the new tube won’t even inflate. </p>

<p>Here was a glory photo from when I thought I fixed it. Haha. WRONG.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/6ghX3zG0Q0a58C0eR-EJHKXSITQEi6rSTgHfdROCIDA=w567-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Otherwise, my day was amazing. I took a beautiful walk at lunch and came across the most bizarre 80’s style fitness track. You can walk around and stop at all these little stations in the woods to work on different skills. I skipped the fitness stations, but eventually I want to come out and play with the rings station. One of my dream goals for life is to be able to do a pull up, and it could be fun to do some aerial skills on this thing:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/loAPNvxCXKdujF5v10SSvcMQfggSCx50DhhmToaDzKs=w567-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Soylent today has been good. It’s hard doing an experiment on yourself. Like I’ve felt a little eugh when it comes to digestive issues. Fortunately, I have yet to become a noxious gas machine like some drinkers report. (Knock on wood). But I definitely felt a little on edge today. However, two of my coworkers went home sick. So is it a stomach bug? Soylent? Guess I’ll find out in a few days.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-63QYJDPwtOc/U-uQM0rbulI/AAAAAAAAHGY/n8WIgvAJfuE/w548-h716-no/IMG_2727.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>My batch today tasted the best yet though. Getting good measurements on a food scale has helped a lot with that. (Since I don’t want to drink a whole 2000 calorie bag). And actually, this is probably disgusting, but I don’t mind it luke warm. I chill it overnight for whatever reason, but I actually kind of enjoy it after it’s gotten back to room temperature. </p>

<p>Whatever, I’m crazy. Hope everyone else’s day went better than my own. :)</p>

	<p>I live in a teeny tiny apartment, my kitchen is probably the size of a lot of people’s closets. And as such, there are only a few small cabinets for storage. So when you receive 40 pounds of food at once, you have to, as Tim Gunn would say, make it work.</p>

<p>This wall has become my make shift pantry.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-SxnftEyBGXY/U-zkSJ4PMrI/AAAAAAAAHLs/_-aN1l9n0NE/s716-no/IMG_2763.JPG" alt="Soylent Wall"></p>

<p>I had no idea what to expect size wise with soylent. And so, I shipped soylent to myself at work, (it would have gotten nicked from my door), not realizing that each week is about 10 pounds. So I’m delivered this pallet of soylent that I have to haul down stairs, across the parking lot, and then up to my apartment. When I finally made it to the apartment, I was covered in sweat and basically looked like a cartoon character shoving my soylent up the last few steps.</p>

<p>Speaking of work, I have a favorite mirror for selfies there. I love it, it’s super flattering, and really really large. But the situation’s a little awkward, because in order to maintain looking professional amongst my coworkers I have to make sure I snap the picture when no one else is there. So I’m always awkwardly looking around making sure the coast is clear and then posing like an idiot.</p>

<p>This weekend is so crazy. I have a friend coming to stay with me for 2 weeks, and she missed her birthday. So I wrapped up a bunch of small things. Then we also have a wedding, an ikea trip, and a bunch of touristy stuff to drag my buddy to. </p>

<p>I’m never going to get any sleep!</p>

<p>What’s your weekend looking like?</p>

	<p>I survived an incredibly busy crazy weekend off Soylent.</p>

<p>To try to maintain some social life, I’m not drinking soylent from Friday night to Sunday night. It allows me to still indulge in regular food, crazy activities, and life without a blender bottle strapped to myself.</p>

<p>The most adorable things I ate this weekend:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-1BMoGda3Bt8/U_F4jUYsskI/AAAAAAAAHVc/znTwOUaT5xw/w643-h716-no/IMG_2822.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>In more exciting news! J’s coworker got married this weekend, which called for a lot of celebrating. The wedding was north of the city in San Rafael, aka Sun Rafael because it’s soooo much warmer. The ceremony was a balmy 90 degrees, but the reception cooled down to a sweet 70. </p>

<p>Crossing the bridge.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-YqOT7uD9EE0/U_F4JLABPcI/AAAAAAAAHVk/lxuzv6mGO6M/w724-h716-no/IMG_2798.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Getting dolled up for the wedding</p>

<p>The oak the ceremony was held under. The theme? Love grows here.</p>

<p>My favorite amped up image of the couple</p>

<p>Overall, this weekend, Soylent taught me how much extra I’ve been eating. I felt more uneasy eating full meals, and I’ve been noticing the heaviness of certain ingredients (sugar, sugar, sugar). My stomach gets upset when it gets to a level I would have considered full just a week ago. And I find myself taking slower, smaller bites.</p>

<p>On the bright side, spending a week on soylent makes everything taste more flavorful. Spices are hotter and more complex. Cuts of meat seem much juicier. Produce is almost unreal after four days of an unarguably bland liquid. </p>

<p>I’ve had mixed feelings about returning to my Soylent only diet tomorrow. Part of me is incredibly excited not to have to think about food. It complicates my life a lot. But another piece of me is sad to give up on all the flavors, tastes, and overindulgences I’ve had this weekend.</p>

<p>I’ve definitely seen a trend down in my weight over the days I’ve had Soylent, which is unsurprising and also wonderful. I’m hoping this mix of soylent and “normal” food will continue to work for me.</p>

	</div>
	<p>Things have been a little crazy here. Most notably this morning I signed both my mom and myself up for SeaWheeze 2015! Woo.</p>

<p>I was super excited for it this year.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/4WtimBfywF1VYbcARzGbXxdfiaif8Z0co0A3F0704Qk=w894-h205-no" alt=""></p>

<p>I wanted to recap my experience with Soylent so far. And hit up what I’ve loved, and what I’ve strugged with. Let me give you a week by week of how it’s been.</p>

<p><strong>Week 1</strong> - Stayed on Soylent all 5 week days. 1200 calories a day on Soylent, uncounted otherwise.</p>

<p><strong>Week 2</strong> - Horrible stressful week with only 1 day Soylent. Let’s not even talk about my eating habits. (I may or may not have gorged myself on a back of mallowcreme pumpkins.)</p>

<p><strong>Week 3</strong> - 2 days Soylent, 500 calories. 5 days muggle food with general moderation.  </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ZU9U9bjti_M/U-zkJH1cDUI/AAAAAAAAIEI/DCMplJYmIRw/w429-h416-no/IMG_2756.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>So what’s going on in my blender?</p>

<p><strong>The Good:</strong><br>
1) I’m recognizing that I have a super weird relationship with food. So when I’m drinking Soylent, it’s helping me get away from some of that. For example, when drinking an adequate amount of Soylent to the point where I’m not hungry. I get this feeling like “I deserve a snack.” Even though I am perfectly satisfied, I’m finding I reward myself with food, even though I didn’t do anything award worthy.</p>

<p>2) Soylent, when drinking it, is not unpleasant.</p>

<p>3) I get a lot more done on days with Soylent. I usually take a brief walk at lunch, clear my head. Finish work earlier, and have more time for activities in the evening.</p>

<p>4) When I drink soylent, I actively want less food days I’m not drinking soylent.  </p>

<p><strong>The Not-So-Good:</strong><br>
1) I feel like a jerk turning my team down for lunch daily, or not being able to meet up with a friend after work. I’m not ready to “out” my Soylent habits yet, so a 5 day spread wasn’t working for me.</p>

<p>2) Even though Soylent tastes great. I hate the way it smells, makes my house smell, makes me smell. It actively makes me not want to drink it, even though the taste, and general experience is great. I have this mental block before I take the first sip, where I think. Shit, this is going to be horrible.</p>

<p>3) Since meals are provided for me at work, this is actually more effort than not doing Soylent.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-uan3B8_4bp4/VAU1KjXdEkI/AAAAAAAAID4/FsGt0Lpv8Vs/w963-h716-no/IMG_3009.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>The food I&#39;ve been wanting to eat with coworkers.</p>

<p>So as you can see from my little week break down. I’m shaking it up and doing a 5:2 split. (5 days off, two days on). Which I may move up to a 4:3 split once I get back from vacationing in Hawaii next week. </p>

<p>I think the most important thing is to find a sustainable way to incorporate this into my life. Honestly, the 5 days on spread, it wasn’t fitting my lifestyle. So I’m trying a method that mimics intermittent fasting more. I’ve liked it (so far) more than fasting, because Soylent even at low calories, takes away any hunger or cravings.</p>

<p>What’s been working for you so far?</p>
