	<p>I have to say, while I usually don’t love looking at my own mediocre pictures of food that I secretly take while (I hope) my coworkers aren’t looking. I get some perverse joy out of seeing what other people are eating, and so in that, I have to indulge you in my Wednesday food lineup. If you too love looking at what others are eating check out <a href="http://peasandcrayons.com/">more here</a>.</p>

<p>This is food no filter. So what I ate, I snapped. Basically, all my meals are provided by my workplace. So I’m a little constrained with what I eat.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/TJJMFn1QlUzjpfCuBH3DXkXqBDnOY3uJ0lLhYfVIBFA=w890-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Breakfast is usually fruit + eggs or cottage cheese. (Plus a giant coffee, black). This is just the most simple meal that will tide me over until lunch. I have this basically every day but Friday. :)</p>

<p>We had a food truck here today that served salads!</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-aSb6075UWVw/VEgCeFI6DhI/AAAAAAAAMTA/pe7EZep8nlY/w955-h716-no/IMG_4039.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Tuna poke salad with carrots, cucumbers, brown rice and a miso dressing. Super delicious but, way too much rice. My bowl looked like this at the end of lunch:</p>

<p>I’m a person who lives off of snacks. So in the afternoon, I had a little of:</p>

<p>And some of</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/XgrbgZ6rEWWi411MZwXCIOK0VHmQmccHA2lUm-TxMfQ=w537-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>I’m not much of a dinner person, so taking one from Oliva Pope, I’ll be having a bowl of popcorn, but no wine. I’d snap a picture, but I haven’t eaten it yet.</p>

<p>Over all, I’d probably like to add some more vegetables to my day, and maybe a little protein. I’m hoping to pick up some Quest bars on the suggestion of a friend, because while my body handles sugar substitutes pretty well, I become a maniac on sugar. Maybe next Wednesday I’ll throw in a real salad. :)</p>

<p>In true form, I can’t end this post without this awesome and hilariously flattering selfie I took and then applied a million filters to this morning. My toggling with weird image settings game is getting so strong.</p>

<p>I know pumpkin is like the it food of the month. I obviously need to work on my pumpkin game. Have you been indulging in any fall favorites?</p>

	<p>Do you ever wonder what people will think of us in 500 years? I had this exact thought this morning. What would a cultural anthropologist a few hundred years from now think of the fact that every Wednesday, a bunch of people post stylized pictures of what they ate that day? </p>

<p>In spite of the fact that researchers in the future will probably think I’m part of a weird food posting cult, and also judge me for eating packaged eggs. I’m still here to report on the things I ate on my <a href="http://peasandcrayons.com/">Wednesday</a>. </p>

<p>Here goes breakfast. Coffee. Kiwi. And the Wilcox bag? That’s two hardboiled eggs. They’re delicious. Judge away.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/bzQ_TbxCbziq7eDjXDYVQxKDznYG3LyNeJ90AoZjHqk=w873-h726-no" alt="Breakfast"></p>

<p>Pardon the lunch shot. I’m still not quite comfortable announcing to my coworkers that I’m going to be photographing my food. But I made a grilled veggie and chicken sandwich and paired it with a macaroni and chickpea soup in a vegetable-tomato broth.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ZezR8-0q7r_o2tyq6jWolba07qwWW2sDypdqDf87av4=w873-h655-no" alt=""></p>

<p>This apple doesn’t look anywhere to actual scale of an apple. But it was my post lunch snack.</p>

<p>Work brought around these cups of chia seed pudding. They were unreal. Diced mango, chia seeds, coconut milk, agave, and mint. Delicious. I may or may not try to recreate this it was so good.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/R33nSfWkH7PN0zsngTEE6oCGWseqWDatIarqpq7ECuc=s873-no" alt="Chia pudding"></p>

<p>It’s not dinner yet here. But I’ll probably snack on something at home. I’m not a big late meal person. I tend to sleep better when I eat less at night.</p>

<p>What&#39;s your current snacking fave? I&#39;m looking for something new. All my summer snacks seem <em>so wrong</em> when we&#39;re approaching winter. </p>
