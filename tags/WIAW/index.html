	<h1><a href="/10-22-2014/WIAW.html">What I ate Wednesday</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		October 22, 2014
	</div>

	<p>I have to say, while I usually don’t love looking at my own mediocre pictures of food that I secretly take while (I hope) my coworkers aren’t looking. I get some perverse joy out of seeing what other people are eating, and so in that, I have to indulge you in my Wednesday food lineup. If you too love looking at what others are eating check out <a href="http://peasandcrayons.com/">more here</a>.</p>

<p>This is food no filter. So what I ate, I snapped. Basically, all my meals are provided by my workplace. So I’m a little constrained with what I eat.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/TJJMFn1QlUzjpfCuBH3DXkXqBDnOY3uJ0lLhYfVIBFA=w890-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Breakfast is usually fruit + eggs or cottage cheese. (Plus a giant coffee, black). This is just the most simple meal that will tide me over until lunch. I have this basically every day but Friday. :)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-MfHRSq3-7l4/VEgCW9NYkEI/AAAAAAAAMSE/H7LNXJd4D2A/w955-h716-no/IMG_4034.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>We had a food truck here today that served salads!</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-aSb6075UWVw/VEgCeFI6DhI/AAAAAAAAMTA/pe7EZep8nlY/w955-h716-no/IMG_4039.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Tuna poke salad with carrots, cucumbers, brown rice and a miso dressing. Super delicious but, way too much rice. My bowl looked like this at the end of lunch:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-52GhPzAC0A4/VEgEF-Cx3pI/AAAAAAAAMUs/7N5S-KdmzGs/w875-h716-no/IMG_4040.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>I’m a person who lives off of snacks. So in the afternoon, I had a little of:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-pU8tj7pG63c/VEfmprnQHvI/AAAAAAAAMUQ/0ZaKsmMxD3w/w604-h716-no/IMG_4028.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>And some of</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/XgrbgZ6rEWWi411MZwXCIOK0VHmQmccHA2lUm-TxMfQ=w537-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>I’m not much of a dinner person, so taking one from Oliva Pope, I’ll be having a bowl of popcorn, but no wine. I’d snap a picture, but I haven’t eaten it yet.</p>

<p>Over all, I’d probably like to add some more vegetables to my day, and maybe a little protein. I’m hoping to pick up some Quest bars on the suggestion of a friend, because while my body handles sugar substitutes pretty well, I become a maniac on sugar. Maybe next Wednesday I’ll throw in a real salad. :)</p>

<p>In true form, I can’t end this post without this awesome and hilariously flattering selfie I took and then applied a million filters to this morning. My toggling with weird image settings game is getting so strong.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-UoHEEtxeCSk/VEfmnrmhYlI/AAAAAAAAMU0/tiR8ErMnqQk/w438-h716-no/IMG_4026.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>I know pumpkin is like the it food of the month. I obviously need to work on my pumpkin game. Have you been indulging in any fall favorites?</p>

	</div>

	<p>Do you ever wonder what people will think of us in 500 years? I had this exact thought this morning. What would a cultural anthropologist a few hundred years from now think of the fact that every Wednesday, a bunch of people post stylized pictures of what they ate that day? </p>

<p>In spite of the fact that researchers in the future will probably think I’m part of a weird food posting cult, and also judge me for eating packaged eggs. I’m still here to report on the things I ate on my <a href="http://peasandcrayons.com/">Wednesday</a>. </p>

<p>Here goes breakfast. Coffee. Kiwi. And the Wilcox bag? That’s two hardboiled eggs. They’re delicious. Judge away.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/bzQ_TbxCbziq7eDjXDYVQxKDznYG3LyNeJ90AoZjHqk=w873-h726-no" alt="Breakfast"></p>

<p>Pardon the lunch shot. I’m still not quite comfortable announcing to my coworkers that I’m going to be photographing my food. But I made a grilled veggie and chicken sandwich and paired it with a macaroni and chickpea soup in a vegetable-tomato broth.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ZezR8-0q7r_o2tyq6jWolba07qwWW2sDypdqDf87av4=w873-h655-no" alt=""></p>

<p>This apple doesn’t look anywhere to actual scale of an apple. But it was my post lunch snack.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/AZfszO_GsXvibP3rk6uRNqq-uM6jgq_Ikq5xGP0AD1g=w873-h863-no" alt="Giant picture of an apple"></p>

<p>Work brought around these cups of chia seed pudding. They were unreal. Diced mango, chia seeds, coconut milk, agave, and mint. Delicious. I may or may not try to recreate this it was so good.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/R33nSfWkH7PN0zsngTEE6oCGWseqWDatIarqpq7ECuc=s873-no" alt="Chia pudding"></p>

<p>It’s not dinner yet here. But I’ll probably snack on something at home. I’m not a big late meal person. I tend to sleep better when I eat less at night.</p>

<p>What&#39;s your current snacking fave? I&#39;m looking for something new. All my summer snacks seem <em>so wrong</em> when we&#39;re approaching winter. </p>

	<h1><a href="/11-12-2014/WIAW.html">What I ate Wednesday</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		November 12, 2014
	</div>

	<p>I am going to blow your mind this week. (Maybe, probably not). If you know me, you know I don’t cook. I mean, up until yesterday I didn’t even have a can opener in my kitchen. (I bought one after I realized the only way I could open my can of coconut milk was to bludgeon it with a screw driver. Oops). This <a href="http://peasandcrayons.com/">Wednesday</a>, I actually made some of my own food. </p>

<p>Breakfast:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-YmNfCoBh6NA/VFz2ONSsOyI/AAAAAAAAN90/pYXEETIdQ9M/w873-h623-no/IMG_4345.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Vanilla coconut chia seed pudding. I am in love with chia seed anything, and so I decided, I had to learn to make this. I don’t have the perfect ratio for this yet (but I’m cloooose). I love my pudding a little less liquidy.</p>

<p>Lunch:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-bDlzNZbXZLg/VGJuxU9Eh4I/AAAAAAAAN9s/XRu-EiGp7mw/w873-h769-no/IMG_4459.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Work lunch. This was a side salad, a cup of vegan potato leek soup, and a piece of whole wheat flatbread with chicken and bacon. Totally delicious. </p>

<p>Snack:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-bme3mSC815I/VF5lf3od1UI/AAAAAAAAN-E/5KWiSo-Rsgw/s873-no/IMG_4360.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>No. I did not eat four larabars. But it’s hard to take a picture every time I want to eat something, so this is from when I bought them. I had the carrot cake. It kinda let me down. I think I’m too much of a child. Only chocolate chip cookie for me. </p>

<p>Other snack: </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-JUUbXzgPRnU/VF1pLpYDFSI/AAAAAAAAN-M/kLspILo3y-A/w873-h1164-no/IMG_4350.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Someone was giving out chocolate outside of my building. Yes please.</p>

<p>I had an apple somewhere in here, but I didn’t snap a photograph. Imagine an apple. </p>

<p>Dinner snack:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Jkyi2vHZ238/VGLUAF7AYEI/AAAAAAAAN9k/WT42_CngX3w/s873-no/IMG_4463.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>I don’t love dinner. But I do love the fact that I’m popping my own popcorn lately. I take some kernals, and coconut oil, wait for them to pop. (And also freak out when they pop. I dropped an entire spoonful of popcorn kernals on the ground when one popped in my face.) Then I smother this in nutritional yeast and a dash of salt. Delish.</p>

<p>What have you been making lately? I&#39;ve been experimenting on a peanut butter mug cake. I found the most irresistable peanut butter chips at Whole Foods this week. :)</p>

	<h1><a href="/11-19-2014/WIAW.html">WIAW</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">

	</div>

	<p>It’s <a href="www.peasandcrayons.com">Wednesday</a> again. And if I could describe my week in one badly taken selfie, it would probably look something like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-eWSO5bbBf7o/VFkVhg0N5_I/AAAAAAAAPAk/he_7vYRZpRs/w434-h716-no/IMG_4240.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>A lot of times, when you see WIAW, you get the most beautiful food of someone’s day. And trust me, I’m going to give you that. But I’m also going to give you my not so great food either. (Although due to the fact that I literally snarfed it up as soon as I got my hands on it, no photo evidence exists.)</p>

<p>But let’s start with the good. My morning started with Pumpkin Chia Seed Pudding. I’m really feeling chia seed pudding, and I can make it the night before, so it works great. I’ll put up a recipe as soon as my camera is here. :) </p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-FWR91pPXUDc/VGY-RMOWsQI/AAAAAAAAO_g/Pq0R5luigKo/w752-h716-no/IMG_4516.JPG" alt="Pumpkin Chia Seed Pudding"></p>

<p>The pumpkin version was… probably good if you love pumpkin. It tasted like pumpkin pie filling to me, but I realized, I’m not a huge “real pumpkin flavor” kind of girl. I want the fakey-fake pumpkin syrup taste. Ooops.</p>

<p>Lunch was amazing. Little tacos and a salad. They had chopped, roasted, delicata squash, and it was a great topper.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/hYu-mbuHrJfA-LhgQtEjyMIGVRR_WBqrbH7z3UGVKSk=w1018-h716-no" alt="tacos and salad"></p>

<p>Lately, to get myself away from my desk, I go grab a spot of froyo. This was a pear-apple blend, with sprinkles for cuteness, and marshmallows because they taste amazing cold.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-dqK7DArD4M0/VGqznuAIspI/AAAAAAAAO-k/NCkE6pPAqd8/w911-h716-no/IMG_4744.JPG" alt="froyo"></p>

<p>Mid-day snack. Some Oloves. Basically olives. They’re so good, and such adorable travel packs. I die.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-GV3cRYUf3gA/VGuEUuwjOcI/AAAAAAAAO9Q/ayN00B9Bw9o/w809-h716-no/IMG_4747.JPG" alt="Oloves"></p>

<p>Finally, a bowl of popcorn at home. Yum</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/KY8auUnHmJIrCAsopI8x_6sf_s8U3AyHr6hzi_kTiSg=w847-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>And that would be a usual day, maybe add another snack, or fruit, if I didn’t discover a giant dispenser of 61% cacao, chocolate covered almonds at work. </p>

<p>No joke, I probably ate like 30. </p>

<p>So now I have a stomach ache, a really delicious stomach ache. And I need someone to wipe my brain so that I don’t know that these beasts are less than 10 minutes away from me. :)</p>

<p>Hahaha. Just kidding about the memory wiping. They were a good treat. But definitely a little over kill on the portion control. </p>

<p>How was your week of eats? Is there some delicious delicious snack you can’t just have one of? What are you cooking lately?</p>

	<h1><a href="/12-3-2014/WIAW.html">WIAW!</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		December 3, 2014
	</div>

	<p>I wasn’t one of those amazing people who only indulged a little over Thanksgiving break. I wasn’t even one of those amazing people who only indulged over Thanksgiving. When I went home, it was serious sugar coma, food party, every single day. And it was amazing.</p>

<p>I made, and ate a bunch of <a href="http://www.averiecooks.com/2013/10/candy-corn-and-white-chocolate-softbatch-cookies.html">these</a> cookies.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/JX0-DdzwpBC0TUVK9XTWfPyipt7LmKqmY4jLAiPdnJY=w955-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>But by the last day I was pretty beat. I was feeling pretty sluggish, sleepy, and fat. So I’ve been trying to tighten up my weekly eats to balance out all my dirty habits. (Also, full disclosure, my brother is proposing to his girlfriend, there’s gonna be a wedding. I want to look good in the photos next year!)</p>

<p>So here&#39;s what I ate <a href="http://peasandcrayons.com/2014/12/ate-wednesday-202.html">Wednesday</a>.</p>

<p>Breakfast was this mondo cup of coffee, (necessary), some hardboiled eggs (which look very very plain in a white bowl), and a pink lady apple. I love and hate this breakfast. Love the way it makes me feel, hate that it’s sooooo boring.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-q0fBdeIzN70/VH9yoHZ94FI/AAAAAAAAP1c/qM_4eLabwOc/w985-h716-no/IMG_5020.JPG" alt="Breakfast"></p>

<p>Lunch salad. Pretty normal. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/z-8ImxGxIRsYXrsTsshHWFmmqk5qTaRiohGBUcf6VDE=w915-h686-no" alt="Salad"></p>

<p>Fancy soup. This was…. carrot ginger I think. I’ve been eating a bunch of soup. My bad.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-CfDZuFSp9As/VH6hYcBRnuI/AAAAAAAAP00/_OVAV2SniFw/w955-h716-no/IMG_4994.JPG" alt="Soup"></p>

<p>My drink of choice lately. Hint fizz. This stuff, this is the best cold drink lately (peppermint tea being the best hot drink.) If you’re in the Bay Area, or really anywhere, you should try this. It’s like, bottled spa water.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/7wCcG6ITXf499nKbPIz11yN4v8zbXzOz97efbrC8xnc=w471-h716-no" alt="hint"></p>

<p>My snack. These nuts are… meh. I want to whip up some energy bites or something this week to replace these guys. I’m just not a peanut person. Why eat peanuts when you could have cashews, almonds, or macadamia nuts? Idk man.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/30T-MAGx-KpIQevJDO3XBAnQpnG_-6sABVNvr3TBSfk=w494-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Dinner was another salad with pulled pork. But I was lazy, and talking to people so I didn’t snap a photo.</p>

<p>Unrelated to eats. But I’ve been listening to this a bunch while getting ready or working. To be frank, it’s officially because it’s my boyfriend’s band playing it. But if you like the garage rock type of sound, it’s worth a listen. Otherwise abort. Honestly. I mostly listen to pop and like maybe venture into indie when I’m feeling daring. I always feel a little more cultured when I go to a show with J, or listen to something outside my listening comfort zone.</p>

<p><iframe class='yt' src="//www.youtube.com/embed/kXxbK23WnJA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>Do you switch your food up, or do you eat the same thing every day? What are you listening to that I should listen to? (Hint, if it’s Hozier, I’m allllllready listening. :) )</p>

	<p>Woah, it’s almost Christmas. </p>

<p>Lately, I’ve been a blur of holiday shopping, project finishing, and Christmas partying this week (J and I have a holiday bash every night this week from Wednesday on. Since they’re all through work, it’s a lot of free delicious food and booze around. Yum, and also yikes!)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-_BZBuJgFq_s/VIf3a9BKLhI/AAAAAAAAQJk/lEyrZkgoGb4/s672-no/holidayparty.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>A friend and I from last year’s holiday party. It’s my one excuse to wear a gorgeous dress in San Francisco. I’ll definitely be snapping photos this year too. </p>

<p>But I wanted to step away from the December madness to bring you what I’m eating before all these festivities. So let’s get down to the <a href="http://peasandcrayons.com/2014/12/ate-wednesday-party-203.html">Wednesday eats</a>. </p>

<p>Breakfast is back with the best bagged eggs I’ve ever had. This is actually my most solid breakfast. I sometimes switch it up with the work buffet breakfast (usually a vegan pancake, eggs, and a slice of bacon.)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ZSGU7kRbZXw/VIfzYmjuOzI/AAAAAAAAQII/jW07GwjHfa0/w832-h672-no/IMG_5087.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Least sexy picture of the year award goes to my lunch. Lately, my goal has been to eat more vegetables. So the solution, and trick to this, is to always eat whatever my lunch is, over a salad. I have a bunch of friends who do this, and I just never caught on. However, it makes my pie-less chicken pot pie look rather unappetizing. Despite its looks, it was delicious.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/sswe8KyKllXY4ZRPFM8QXh4vnhoBfOByiW-hpjJXeAnW=w807-h672-no" alt=""></p>

<p>In this photo, I&#39;m straight up clawing my afternoon snack. I’ve been craving chocolate lately, and this chocolate covered coconut snack is amazing, and in small enough portions that I don’t eat an entire coconut’s worth. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/5bVQvp7q5p5osMWowky1lKUkBJ8S7cMBWO-VL-FM7OQg=s672-no" alt=""></p>

<p>I’m not much of a dinner person, but I met up with a friend for the vietnamese version of Chipotle. Which features yet another salad. Totally delicious. J and I have had this once before, and I literally can recommend everything I’ve had provided you like avocado, jalapeno, cilantro and pineapple. :)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/jakvuyWrhayTazahy7L1dtx1azaGvUDd3s5cIjE-ebC_=w896-h672-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Not a bad day! I think I’m due to eliminate some more sugar from my everyday eats, but otherwise I’m more satisfied with the food I’m sharing.</p>

<p>I definitely need to sit down and write some more things up. I recently got eyelash extensions (love), am decorating my teeny tiny apartment’s exterior for a contents (bring on the washi tape), and hit up a giant craft fair with a bunch of friends.</p>

<p>Are you prepared for the holidays? Any killer parties, or traditions I should start? I think I need to start a baking list for when I go back home. Anything (healthy, or less healthy) I should look into? :)</p>

	<p>Indulge me for a minute, before I get to my normal daily eats. I want to share some of the pictures that came back from the holiday parties we went to last weekend. When I was going through the album for the entire party, it’s all cute couples pictures, standing together, hugging, kissing, and then you get to me and J.</p>

<p>J is one of the coolest guys ever (in my book), because while I’m only showing you two of the shots we got back, there are 10, and he worked it in every single one. I love a man who will strike ridiculous poses with me.</p>

<p>Okay, back to the eats!</p>

<p>I obviously had a little bit of a sweet tooth today. So enjoy what happens when craving attack. <a href="http://peasandcrayons.com/2014/12/wiaw-204.html">What I ate Wednesday</a> style.</p>

<p>If you’ve followed along, you know that my breakfast is usually bagged eggs and fruit. (Sexy, I know). But, I switched it up a bit this morning with steel cut oats, topped with cinnamon, ground flax, cranberries, raisins, toasted coconut and a little nugget or two of brown sugar. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/hJ9dLEWW67Y5OVrfOYXAGOpfsqKki5mC0JAg2dDm4656=w915-h984-no" alt=""></p>

<p>My lunch has been salad focused. So here is a big salad with miso dressing along with a few slices of tuna maki. I didn’t eat the matcha rice pictured, I don’t have anything against eating it, except I don’t really enjoy the texture of rice unless it’s masked by something much more delicious, like raw tuna.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-UeZGcLDiQQo/VIC5oWGyzCI/AAAAAAAAQIQ/uGlZ4aJBomQ/w914-h541-no/IMG_5027.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Post lunch, team froyo. It’s hard to tell, but this is actually vanilla yogurt, mixed with a chocolate banana (made with actual banana) “soft serve”. I then topped it with sprinkles and white chocolate shavings. My sister has told me before that serving it in this tiny cup is an embarrassment of ice cream. I sort of agree.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/mNuaGgKPmxGVTFfCgW9HTK0JXlrNo85SGTCC6sCh5wwo=w915-h882-no" alt=""></p>

<p>A sneaky selfie of me and an “Apple Pear”. Whatever these fruit are, they’re in season, I’ve probably had one daily. I’ve had to get a bowl to catch the serious amount of juice in this fruit.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/roI7cTmT6un63AgbuIgJbe9k9vMmkNC4lnMv6Jd9UbpK=w915-h1075-no" alt=""></p>

<p>This is a shot cup of a bunch of chocolate covered almonds. Delicious. I probably need to cut these out of my daily eats. They’re so delicious, but I think every time I go grab a cup, another almond sneaks it’s way in. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-xpbgRcVJ3Cq2xZLWCj8y5xpb05iTT1do6rROEp7t6CF=s915-no" alt=""></p>

<p>I also ate an orange, later that night. But I’ll admit this was a pretty protein free, sugar filled day.</p>

<p>I’m inclined to fix that stuff up after the New Year, but honestly, if this is my average day moving through the holidays. I’m pretty thrilled. My biggest goals over the next three weeks are to move a bunch, and to not eat an entire tray of cookies unless it’s worth it. :)</p>

<p>What do you crave? Do you have a signature pose for photobooths? I swear when they count down, I never know how to pose!</p>

	<div class="date">

	</div>

	<p>Good morning! (Or really, whenever you happen to be reading this). Usually, on Wednesdays, I break down all the delicious things I eat for <a href="http://peasandcrayons.com/2014/12/merry-christmahanukwanzaakah-wiaw-205-2.html">WIAW</a>. And today isn’t any different, except that, this morning, we had our big family Christmas.</p>

<p>So this late blog, is brought to you by sugar-cookie, animal-shaped waffles. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-dGBlwomLlIc/VJsKKdOmRLI/AAAAAAAASJk/zjshDFpz-Mk/w896-h672-no/wafflecollage.png" alt="Waffles"></p>

<p>I’ve been home, in Chicago for the week, so aside from the time change, the weather change, and the change in scenery, my eating schedule also feels wonky. Lunch and dinner feel too early, all the food tastes different, etc. By Wednesday, I was kind of craving my normal.</p>

<p>One of the great things about having homogenous work offices is it’s easy to get similar food everywhere. So after the serious cookie overload, I was ready to get something a little healthier in me.</p>

<p>I started with fruit and a biscotti. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/TqRyscLqsRDqSU7ALcZdxwF6gmaetqfPRyOlLRufr8_h=w973-h716-no" alt="Breakfast"></p>

<p>Lunch was a salad with pico de gallo, corn, olives, and root vegetable puree, carrot ginger soup, and a cut of arctic char (Which I found out, after watching Alton Brown on the plane for 5 hours, is a close relative of both salmon, and trout, aka delicious).</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-SLtaXMmflME/VJhprozEsDI/AAAAAAAARzM/GIkJ_mHWNio/w1041-h599-no/IMG_5578.JPG" alt="Lunch"></p>

<p>Mid-day, the chef team put out vats of hot chocolate. Who was I to say no? </p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Q-AtKJkaJ5zaBuMOsJ_Lvxp643pjACsSExKy3DUVPpIn=w616-h716-no" alt="Hot chocolate snack"></p>

<p>I actually didn’t end up finishing it all, and when I washed out my cup, found a layer of sprinkles caked onto the bottom. Can we say, addiction?</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-g6-NmHLdqHs/VJsIl4H3XbI/AAAAAAAASJY/YuexHojVwYI/s672-no/IMG_5697.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>When I got home I had a tea and some sugar cookies. Not like I was ever going to escape those. I think every day of the holidays should include some amount of cookies. 
Not pictured are the copious cups of coffee I’ve been drinking, and the small mountain of other sweets I’ve been enjoying since everyone is in a baking mood.</p>

<p>A merry, merry Christmas to those who celebrate it! I hope you all get wonderful gifts tomorrow, and stay close to family. While I rocked the gift giving and receiving today, tomorrow I get the best gift ever, because J lands in Chicago to spend the week with me. :)</p>

<p>What are you hoping to receive? What’s the best gift you’re giving? Have you eaten as much delicious food as I have recently?</p>

	<h1><a href="/1-7-2015/WIAW.html">WIAW - Resolution Style</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		January 7, 2015
	</div>

	<p>Guys. I don’t want to jinx it. But, the new year has me motivated. Real motivated. Like, spend-two-hours-power-cleaning-your-apartment-when-you-get-home-from-work motivated. </p>

<p>And it’s been spilling over evvvverywhere. One of the things I knew I needed to rock in January was my eating habits, especially important after I consumed no less than 23495 Christmas cookies while home last week.</p>

<p>So I’m trying to rock way more vegetables, way less sugar, and just a generally healthier eating schedule. So welcome to my favorite day of the week, <a href="http://peasandcrayons.com/2015/01/ate-wednesday-207.html">WIAW</a>.</p>

<p>Breakfast is standard. Greek yogurt, so much coffee, and asian pears.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-34vH2atyNig/VKwwq9zXEEI/AAAAAAAAS6U/V1WQzZxeQgg/w915-h912-no/IMG_5924.JPG" alt="Breakfast"></p>

<p>Welcome to “put your lunch over a salad” salad. One of my good friends in Chicago used to be a chef in a fancy Vegas restaurant, and when I told him about this food strategy, he threatened to disown me. Apparently, greens don’t automatically pair well with “everything”.</p>

<p>So this is shredded pork, guacamole, jalapenos, pico de gallo, over a salad. I couldn’t decide between the salsa roja, or the yogurt based salsa demente, so I used both. :)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ChUEd77bnX0/VKxjoXi4s7I/AAAAAAAAS9o/zDJxTCxy-VM/w915-h708-no/IMG_5928.JPG" alt="Lunch"></p>

<p>Snack was an old favorite. Popcorn, which I grabbed a handful or two and put into a vintage Santa mug. I’d like to say it’s because I still have a lot of Christmas spirit, but really it’s because I’m too lazy to put away my decorations.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-b6qoUn8hyRM/VKxkINWrasI/AAAAAAAAS9w/WRMWTLOuAac/w915-h985-no/IMG_5937.JPG" alt="Popcorn"></p>

<p>This is the post where you find out my hands are literally like paddles, or giant oven mitts. But I grabbed a handful of nuts. Best part? NO PEANUTS. I hate nut mixes that are dominated by peanuts. Put them in a nut butter, great. Put them in a trail mix and I’m over it. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-fQwpnx64LRk/VKx3W5v5wgI/AAAAAAAAS-s/5FVfJcmwtLc/w915-h1029-no/IMG_5939.JPG" alt="Nuts"></p>

<p>I had a grand total of three of these parmesan crisps (15 is a serving). But they were so delicious and satiating that I needed to include them. So enjoy the speckled brown that is my dirt floor, and do yourself a favor (if you like dairy) and get on these, or make them.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/J30cWAq9evBae1McsNtRkW3QJhxAGwzlcf1SHJ7kA78l=w915-h1046-no" alt="Parm Crisps"></p>

<p>Usually, I’m not much for dinner. But I’m trying to rectify that, and realize that popcorn is not a vegetable. So here’s salad part two. I try to relish in the fact that by eating this salad I’m now ahead of <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/wk/mm5935.pdf">75% of Americans in vegetable eating</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ZFOJvOFFc5Nhj83TxRByp9k-nWfMsJHfEJ-Gd7Eusf-d=w728-h716-no" alt="Dinner Salad"></p>

<p>Last, unrelated little tidbit. Today is the best Wednesday regardless of what I ate because it’s my mom’s birthday! Even though I hopefully already texted and called her, I want to wish her a third, or fourth Happy Birthday. </p>

<p>She’s not only had to put up with me for over 20 years, but she’s down for anything, we’ve done flying trapeze, surfed, and this year we’re running Seawheeze together.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-wk05N2A9x-w/VKzTfe5LccI/AAAAAAAATAQ/3BURMU1W6KM/w960-h640-no/momsurf.jpg" alt="Mom surfing"></p>

<p>So Happy Birthday Madre!</p>

<p>How’s your Wednesday going? </p>

	<h1><a href="/1-14-2015/WIAW.html">WIAW - Craving's ahoy</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		January 14, 2015
	</div>

	<p>This <a href="http://peasandcrayons.com/2015/01/ate-wednesday-208.html">Wednesday</a> was brought to you by my cravings. It was a day I ate the things I was hungry for. Which worked out pretty well overall.</p>

<p>In the next few WIAW, I think I might experiment spending a day eating other popular diets. While I like the way I eat now, I think it might be fun to shake things up in the New Year. My work offers a lot of flexibility when it comes to vegan, paleo, raw, gluten free, etc diets, and while I have the chance I should try it.</p>

<p>The day started with a pretty standard cup of steel cut oats, I added, raisins, coconut, peanut butter, and a little bit of ground flax and cinnamon. Delicious, once I stirred it all together. But needed more protein. I was ravenous by lunch!</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-aTCM_ILWK-Q/VLVKMHgp9hI/AAAAAAAATdk/waIBUaoWuS4/w955-h716-no/IMG_6045.JPG" alt="breakfast"></p>

<p>Lunch was slightly large. I had both a grilled chicken sandwich, and vegan broccoli-kale soup. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-lmH2PkbQ4qs/VLX0ajAjIJI/AAAAAAAATdM/rzSylSquBes/w973-h716-no/IMG_6053.JPG" alt="lunch"></p>

<p>I was looking forward to the chicken when I ordered it, but I have to say, this soup was the star. Packed with vegetables, and a smooth consistency, you can bet I’m ordering this guy again.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-1t3kEu1EU2U/VLX0eSO86kI/AAAAAAAATdU/VXcJ3uOR4Wo/w948-h716-no/IMG_6055.JPG" alt="lunch soup"></p>

<p>So many snacks today! I’ve been eating my weight in satsuma mandarins lately. They are delicious. I had one with a little bag of pistachios. (Small win, this is the first bag of pistachios where I’ve been able to unshell every single one!)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-j3Uf0qpReQs/VLVYFbmw8PI/AAAAAAAATd4/uFwz4jqyQFU/w955-h716-no/IMG_6049.JPG" alt="snack nuts and orange"></p>

<p>And a little square of cheese. I love cheese, and have split entire cheese plates with others before. I’m always a little sad when I realize this is the serving size.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-xWdbSCPOF9o/VLX0gc8k4II/AAAAAAAATeA/loYxSCAkuAA/w715-h716-no/IMG_6056.JPG" alt="snack cheese"></p>

<p>Old habits die hard. Also I had a really long yoga class that stretched past dinner. So when I biked home at 8 pm, I didn’t really want to do more than put a pot of popcorn on the stove.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/AGD2fVv4LCD-IpOliBHLiZ5IRirjuFlzDY-fkOidK5-o=w955-h716-no" alt="Dinner popcorn"></p>

<p>Also unpictured, a cookies and cream quest bar. But! I kind of hated this. Did I eat this wrong? It was kind of slimy and the only redeeming quality was the cookie portion of this guy. I’ve heard people microwave and broil these, does that make it better?</p>

<p>What’s the best thing you ate all day? the worst? How do you eat a quest bar (if you eat them)?</p>
