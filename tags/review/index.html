	<p>I was a kid who should have been born on the water. Every time I’ve been to the ocean, for surfing, stand-up paddle boarding, or just swimming, I’ve had a blast. Maybe even the best time of my life. Unfortunately, thanks to a midwest upbringing, skin that burns at the slightest hint of sun, and the serious cost of ocean activities, I’ve never been able to actually improve my surf skills after the initial lesson.</p>

<p>Enter Surf Set.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Hlg3axFxiPtkNIElZuHBnwmIwLrx2x6tXBrQN4Eb1jA=w1038-h657-no" alt=""></p>

<p>For those of you who haven’t heard of it before, Surf Set is pretty much like surfing on land. (A lovely experience for those of us who want to avoid burns, uncomfortable wet suits, and sharks). A surf board balanced on three, bosu-like balls, mimics the instability of the ocean. The class lets you practice both moves necessary to improve surfing, but also other non-traditional strength, cardio, and flexibility building moves.</p>

<p><a href="http://almostgettingittogether.com/surfset-review/">Cassie</a> and I went to a morning Surf Set class, at a super cute studio called <a href="http://sweatrepublicsf.com/">Sweat Republic</a>, and fell in love.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-mfYYDvf6rLY/VGAsnKEbw2I/AAAAAAAAN0E/eos1EQB8u-w/w955-h716-no/IMG_0482.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Excuse the extreme cheesing and the incorrect hand positioning. I need some more classes under my belt before I look good doing this. :)</p>

<p>The instructor was extremely friendly, and took a lot of time coming around to help correct poses, challenge students, and even help me jump from the ground onto a surfboard. It turns out she was actually a surfer, which reinforced the fact that this may actually help if I ever get on the water again.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-SlD3yMuCT2U/VGAsjSAjK8I/AAAAAAAANzI/LzGpNT_CYRM/w955-h716-no/IMG_0474.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>The class began with a quick warm up, which was primarily comprised of on the ground stretching.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-PTvGEiI4jvo/VGAsinyw29I/AAAAAAAAN0w/raeZdMXIxW0/w955-h716-no/IMG_0473.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>We worked our way through cardio, strength training, balancing, and a mock surf session in the hour long class. While I definitely sweat some, I felt it most the next day in my obliques. Balancing and stability are good for the abs. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-O9CprsRrpvU/VGAshU5weGI/AAAAAAAAN0c/EJRvwyrHyP0/w955-h716-no/IMG_0471.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>I had such an amazing time. Sometimes, when I read about classes in San Francisco, and they say “All Levels”, I interpret that as “All levels of people who are already physically fit”. </p>

<p>As someone who has a little bit of performance anxiety This class was actually “All Levels”, there are a bunch of different ways to customize both the difficulty of the boards, and the moves involved to make it work for you. The class went by super fast, and I can&#39;t wait to go again this weekend.</p>

<p>Would you surf on land? What crazy fitness class do I need to find next in San Francisco?</p>

	<h1><a href="/12-16-2014/sevenly-cause-box.html">Sevenly Cause Box Review where I tell you how much I loved it.</a></h1>
	<div class="metadata">

	<p>I’ll admit, I kind of love subscription boxes. It seems backwards, not knowing what you’re getting when you pay for it. But, as an adult buying boring things like ziploc bags, and dishwasher liquid, sometimes, online shopping gets boring. So subscription boxes are the closest thing I can get to buying myself presents.</p>

<p>I’ve been loving <a href="sevenly.org">Sevenly</a> forever. They have the softest, most flattering shirts ever and they let me feel as if I’m helping people at the same time.</p>

<p>So when they launched a quarterly box of products that benefit good causes, not gonna lie I bought a year of it. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/VVMY7o2A5N-yFKHjazvYSSIjA8MFgEhWgf51wHmcrHY0=w1036-h716-no" alt="The box"></p>

<p>I got the box at work today, and it was a little beat up. But I&#39;m not one to judge a book by it&#39;s cover (at least when it comes to boxes I really really want to open), I am one however to take photos on a black background with a white blog. Ooops!</p>

<p>The first thing I got out of the box was a super cute pack of Thank You notes. They&#39;re printed in LA and gorgeous photos. But the best part is that it comes with a wax seal. If you get a random thank you in the next year, it&#39;s because all I want to do now is press wax letter seals now.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the unopened package.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/hsS7v61BGcSdmTxhFBqYapWJeVg9wBJ4bObuKppoQvcl=s716-no" alt="First package of thank you notes"></p>

<p>The four cards. They&#39;re post card format, I can&#39;t wait to send them. Although, I&#39;m not sure if anyone&#39;s thankful for cold weather scenes.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-3KAsUrBfwcE/VI-8cyvixNI/AAAAAAAARG4/_NmWDkJURqY/s716-no/IMG_5364.JPG" alt="Cards and the stamp"></p>

<p>And here&#39;s the stamp and wax up close. I love that the stamp says &quot;thx&quot;. But now I&#39;m going to want one for all my letters, not just my thank you cards. I&#39;ll have to find one with a heart, or a star, or my name, which might be a little self inflated.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/gZeM2EEF4SN4NdiwZiDgZHxCXHXpJNXYgFum1lcyzMSq=w895-h716-no" alt="Stamp pattern and envelope"></p>

<p>The next part of the box was the Sevenly Change for Change jar. One of J and my&#39;s ultimate first world problems is that J hates having change in his pockets, wallet, car, etc. So I dump all the change in my purse. Last time I emptied my purse I had 17 dollars in coins in it. Now I have somewhere more reasonable to drop my change than empty candle jars. And I&#39;ll feel guilted into donating it. :)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-2CZlFZZi980/VI-8xCzounI/AAAAAAAARGA/dupxsBcYgGo/w800-h716-no/IMG_5381.JPG" alt="Cutest change jar"></p>

<p>An adorable handwoven scarf. I need more solid, plain scarves. When all your scarves have birds, or chains, or prints on them, they get harder to wear with other things. :) Love this one.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-xK0M_5B_f1s/VI-86R72lGI/AAAAAAAARGY/nddDfTPheWc/w799-h716-no/IMG_5397.JPG" alt="Scarf"></p>

<p>My favorite piece was a little tiny elephant necklace. I&#39;ve been wearing it already, it&#39;s the perfect length, and it sits super flat on my neck, which is so amazing. But. Elephants are my favorite animals ever. So this was basically made for me.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/PbeCMcJT32U7954ur7V2-OrWKw2qrm6kcgN45HEBnUsJ=w679-h716-no" alt="A little tiny elephant necklace"></p>

<p>A tiny purse I&#39;m going to use as a makeup bag for flights and traveling in between J and my places. It&#39;s much much prettier than it looks in the photos. And it&#39;s the perfect size for travel.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/dGh61TRQd-LR_M9-dH66pC2gtUMyNLJmcVKr-kzpZG88=w933-h716-no" alt="Little baby purse"></p>

<p>And last but not least, the snacks! Delicious little cacao nibs, and a glorified granola bar. They&#39;re both gluten free, and the nibs are delicious. The bar I&#39;m saving for my flight home for the holidays.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-fdt4YHAxw_I/VI-8sSU5NYI/AAAAAAAARF4/XnvxwSxofkw/w619-h716-no/IMG_5377.JPG" alt="Snacks"></p>

<p>Overall, this is one of the few boxes where I actually felt like the amount I paid was pretty well reflected in the final product. I&#39;ve seen a lot of make-up/beauty subscription boxes and while I love the idea, I just don&#39;t need another lip gloss, or face moisturizer. So the items in those boxes often end up being not worth the product for me. But I actually plan on using all the items in this one. Sorry friends, I won&#39;t be regifting. :)</p>

<p>I bought this myself, but Sevenly is cool. I just happened to really like it, and I love finding new subscription boxes, so I figured I&#39;d share it with you. :)</p>

<p>Do you subscribe to any subscriptions? (I also love <a href="http://www.footcardigan.com/">Foot Cardigan</a> and <a href="https://www.stitchfix.com/">Stitch Fix</a>) What&#39;s the best gift you&#39;ve gotten yourself?</p>
