	<h1><a href="/6-9-2014/lazy-bear.html">Lazy Bear, the ultimate eating experience</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		June 9, 2014
	</div>

	<p>Ever find something decidedly cool, from an incredibly uncool place? J and I found out about Lazy Bear, an underground dinner you sign up for lottery style a few months ago. After months of putting our names in, we finally were chosen for this many many course experience. We thought we were cool, and hip, and maybe read it in the New York Times, or heard it from a food loving friend. </p>

<p>But no. It was Yelp. The number one rated “restaurant” in SF. Not so cool. The courses were all amazing, and there are so many, that I won’t describe every one in detail.</p>

<p>Let’s begin. I missed snapping photos of some of the initial courses, so, this is not representative of the full meal.</p>

	<h1><a href="/10-22-2014/WIAW.html">What I ate Wednesday</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		October 22, 2014
	</div>

	<p>I have to say, while I usually don’t love looking at my own mediocre pictures of food that I secretly take while (I hope) my coworkers aren’t looking. I get some perverse joy out of seeing what other people are eating, and so in that, I have to indulge you in my Wednesday food lineup. If you too love looking at what others are eating check out <a href="http://peasandcrayons.com/">more here</a>.</p>

<p>This is food no filter. So what I ate, I snapped. Basically, all my meals are provided by my workplace. So I’m a little constrained with what I eat.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/TJJMFn1QlUzjpfCuBH3DXkXqBDnOY3uJ0lLhYfVIBFA=w890-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Breakfast is usually fruit + eggs or cottage cheese. (Plus a giant coffee, black). This is just the most simple meal that will tide me over until lunch. I have this basically every day but Friday. :)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-MfHRSq3-7l4/VEgCW9NYkEI/AAAAAAAAMSE/H7LNXJd4D2A/w955-h716-no/IMG_4034.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>We had a food truck here today that served salads!</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-aSb6075UWVw/VEgCeFI6DhI/AAAAAAAAMTA/pe7EZep8nlY/w955-h716-no/IMG_4039.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Tuna poke salad with carrots, cucumbers, brown rice and a miso dressing. Super delicious but, way too much rice. My bowl looked like this at the end of lunch:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-52GhPzAC0A4/VEgEF-Cx3pI/AAAAAAAAMUs/7N5S-KdmzGs/w875-h716-no/IMG_4040.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>I’m a person who lives off of snacks. So in the afternoon, I had a little of:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-pU8tj7pG63c/VEfmprnQHvI/AAAAAAAAMUQ/0ZaKsmMxD3w/w604-h716-no/IMG_4028.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>And some of</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/XgrbgZ6rEWWi411MZwXCIOK0VHmQmccHA2lUm-TxMfQ=w537-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>I’m not much of a dinner person, so taking one from Oliva Pope, I’ll be having a bowl of popcorn, but no wine. I’d snap a picture, but I haven’t eaten it yet.</p>

<p>Over all, I’d probably like to add some more vegetables to my day, and maybe a little protein. I’m hoping to pick up some Quest bars on the suggestion of a friend, because while my body handles sugar substitutes pretty well, I become a maniac on sugar. Maybe next Wednesday I’ll throw in a real salad. :)</p>

<p>In true form, I can’t end this post without this awesome and hilariously flattering selfie I took and then applied a million filters to this morning. My toggling with weird image settings game is getting so strong.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-UoHEEtxeCSk/VEfmnrmhYlI/AAAAAAAAMU0/tiR8ErMnqQk/w438-h716-no/IMG_4026.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>I know pumpkin is like the it food of the month. I obviously need to work on my pumpkin game. Have you been indulging in any fall favorites?</p>

	</div>

	<p>Do you ever wonder what people will think of us in 500 years? I had this exact thought this morning. What would a cultural anthropologist a few hundred years from now think of the fact that every Wednesday, a bunch of people post stylized pictures of what they ate that day? </p>

<p>In spite of the fact that researchers in the future will probably think I’m part of a weird food posting cult, and also judge me for eating packaged eggs. I’m still here to report on the things I ate on my <a href="http://peasandcrayons.com/">Wednesday</a>. </p>

<p>Here goes breakfast. Coffee. Kiwi. And the Wilcox bag? That’s two hardboiled eggs. They’re delicious. Judge away.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/bzQ_TbxCbziq7eDjXDYVQxKDznYG3LyNeJ90AoZjHqk=w873-h726-no" alt="Breakfast"></p>

<p>Pardon the lunch shot. I’m still not quite comfortable announcing to my coworkers that I’m going to be photographing my food. But I made a grilled veggie and chicken sandwich and paired it with a macaroni and chickpea soup in a vegetable-tomato broth.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ZezR8-0q7r_o2tyq6jWolba07qwWW2sDypdqDf87av4=w873-h655-no" alt=""></p>

<p>This apple doesn’t look anywhere to actual scale of an apple. But it was my post lunch snack.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/AZfszO_GsXvibP3rk6uRNqq-uM6jgq_Ikq5xGP0AD1g=w873-h863-no" alt="Giant picture of an apple"></p>

<p>Work brought around these cups of chia seed pudding. They were unreal. Diced mango, chia seeds, coconut milk, agave, and mint. Delicious. I may or may not try to recreate this it was so good.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/R33nSfWkH7PN0zsngTEE6oCGWseqWDatIarqpq7ECuc=s873-no" alt="Chia pudding"></p>

<p>It’s not dinner yet here. But I’ll probably snack on something at home. I’m not a big late meal person. I tend to sleep better when I eat less at night.</p>

<p>What&#39;s your current snacking fave? I&#39;m looking for something new. All my summer snacks seem <em>so wrong</em> when we&#39;re approaching winter. </p>

	<h1><a href="/11-12-2014/WIAW.html">What I ate Wednesday</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		November 12, 2014
	</div>

	<p>I am going to blow your mind this week. (Maybe, probably not). If you know me, you know I don’t cook. I mean, up until yesterday I didn’t even have a can opener in my kitchen. (I bought one after I realized the only way I could open my can of coconut milk was to bludgeon it with a screw driver. Oops). This <a href="http://peasandcrayons.com/">Wednesday</a>, I actually made some of my own food. </p>

<p>Breakfast:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-YmNfCoBh6NA/VFz2ONSsOyI/AAAAAAAAN90/pYXEETIdQ9M/w873-h623-no/IMG_4345.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Vanilla coconut chia seed pudding. I am in love with chia seed anything, and so I decided, I had to learn to make this. I don’t have the perfect ratio for this yet (but I’m cloooose). I love my pudding a little less liquidy.</p>

<p>Lunch:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-bDlzNZbXZLg/VGJuxU9Eh4I/AAAAAAAAN9s/XRu-EiGp7mw/w873-h769-no/IMG_4459.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Work lunch. This was a side salad, a cup of vegan potato leek soup, and a piece of whole wheat flatbread with chicken and bacon. Totally delicious. </p>

<p>Snack:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-bme3mSC815I/VF5lf3od1UI/AAAAAAAAN-E/5KWiSo-Rsgw/s873-no/IMG_4360.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>No. I did not eat four larabars. But it’s hard to take a picture every time I want to eat something, so this is from when I bought them. I had the carrot cake. It kinda let me down. I think I’m too much of a child. Only chocolate chip cookie for me. </p>

<p>Other snack: </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-JUUbXzgPRnU/VF1pLpYDFSI/AAAAAAAAN-M/kLspILo3y-A/w873-h1164-no/IMG_4350.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Someone was giving out chocolate outside of my building. Yes please.</p>

<p>I had an apple somewhere in here, but I didn’t snap a photograph. Imagine an apple. </p>

<p>Dinner snack:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Jkyi2vHZ238/VGLUAF7AYEI/AAAAAAAAN9k/WT42_CngX3w/s873-no/IMG_4463.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>I don’t love dinner. But I do love the fact that I’m popping my own popcorn lately. I take some kernals, and coconut oil, wait for them to pop. (And also freak out when they pop. I dropped an entire spoonful of popcorn kernals on the ground when one popped in my face.) Then I smother this in nutritional yeast and a dash of salt. Delish.</p>

<p>What have you been making lately? I&#39;ve been experimenting on a peanut butter mug cake. I found the most irresistable peanut butter chips at Whole Foods this week. :)</p>

	<h1><a href="/11-19-2014/WIAW.html">WIAW</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">

	</div>

	<p>It’s <a href="//www.peasandcrayons.com">Wednesday</a> again. And if I could describe my week in one badly taken selfie, it would probably look something like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-eWSO5bbBf7o/VFkVhg0N5_I/AAAAAAAAPAk/he_7vYRZpRs/w434-h716-no/IMG_4240.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>A lot of times, when you see WIAW, you get the most beautiful food of someone’s day. And trust me, I’m going to give you that. But I’m also going to give you my not so great food either. (Although due to the fact that I literally snarfed it up as soon as I got my hands on it, no photo evidence exists.)</p>

<p>But let’s start with the good. My morning started with Pumpkin Chia Seed Pudding. I’m really feeling chia seed pudding, and I can make it the night before, so it works great. I’ll put up a recipe as soon as my camera is here. :) </p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-FWR91pPXUDc/VGY-RMOWsQI/AAAAAAAAO_g/Pq0R5luigKo/w752-h716-no/IMG_4516.JPG" alt="Pumpkin Chia Seed Pudding"></p>

<p>The pumpkin version was… probably good if you love pumpkin. It tasted like pumpkin pie filling to me, but I realized, I’m not a huge “real pumpkin flavor” kind of girl. I want the fakey-fake pumpkin syrup taste. Ooops.</p>

<p>Lunch was amazing. Little tacos and a salad. They had chopped, roasted, delicata squash, and it was a great topper.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/hYu-mbuHrJfA-LhgQtEjyMIGVRR_WBqrbH7z3UGVKSk=w1018-h716-no" alt="tacos and salad"></p>

<p>Lately, to get myself away from my desk, I go grab a spot of froyo. This was a pear-apple blend, with sprinkles for cuteness, and marshmallows because they taste amazing cold.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-dqK7DArD4M0/VGqznuAIspI/AAAAAAAAO-k/NCkE6pPAqd8/w911-h716-no/IMG_4744.JPG" alt="froyo"></p>

<p>Mid-day snack. Some Oloves. Basically olives. They’re so good, and such adorable travel packs. I die.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-GV3cRYUf3gA/VGuEUuwjOcI/AAAAAAAAO9Q/ayN00B9Bw9o/w809-h716-no/IMG_4747.JPG" alt="Oloves"></p>

<p>Finally, a bowl of popcorn at home. Yum</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/KY8auUnHmJIrCAsopI8x_6sf_s8U3AyHr6hzi_kTiSg=w847-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>And that would be a usual day, maybe add another snack, or fruit, if I didn’t discover a giant dispenser of 61% cacao, chocolate covered almonds at work. </p>

<p>No joke, I probably ate like 30. </p>

<p>So now I have a stomach ache, a really delicious stomach ache. And I need someone to wipe my brain so that I don’t know that these beasts are less than 10 minutes away from me. :)</p>

<p>Hahaha. Just kidding about the memory wiping. They were a good treat. But definitely a little over kill on the portion control. </p>

<p>How was your week of eats? Is there some delicious delicious snack you can’t just have one of? What are you cooking lately?</p>

	<h1><a href="/1-21-2015/vegan-WIAW.html">What I ate Wednesday, Vegan Exploration!</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		January 21, 2015
	</div>

	<p><a href="http://www.kaybueno.com/1-14-2015/WIAW.html">Last week</a>, I felt like my WIAW were becoming predictable. I think if I took another picture of oatmeal, or bagged eggs, my iPhone camera was going to revolt. In order to keep my sanity, and make sure my camera roll wasn’t full up of the same pictures shot every Tuesday. I decided to try different eating styles for <a href="//www.peasandcrayons.com">WIAW</a>.</p>

<p>This Wednesday I decided to explore what it’s like to be a Vegan. Obviously, doing something for one day doesn’t produce a lot of mindblowing outcomes, and there’s no before/after. I figured it would get me out of a food rut and make me try something new. My goal was to not show you my usual week made vegan, but to try to go “all in” and pick the food I felt best fit the diet. </p>

<p>Today, I ran in late after helping bandage up J’s wounds, so I didn’t have time to grab breakfast from a cafe. It was a little hard to avoid the call of eggs and yogurt, my usual morning staples. But I found a perfectly ripe banana and some Justin’s and combined.</p>

<p>I only have the before picture, but I cut the banana in half and spread the peanut butter inside. Enough of my co-workers walked by and joked that I didn’t have a future in surgery, so you just get this:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-YHWB5kyPtD0/VL7tpPMqSxI/AAAAAAAAUTs/J9xnVuuzGYs/w600-h500-no/15%2B-%2B1" alt="banana and peanut butter"></p>

<p>One of my concerns about taking a vegan day at work was that I’d spend the day eating side dishes, and never feel full. Fortunately, I found a cafe that had quite a few solid vegan entrees. I’m terrible at deciding, so I picked two dishes, figuring I could just eat half of each.</p>

<p>I ate all of both.</p>

<p>The first was an Eggplant Caponata, Pine Nuts, and Whole Wheat Pita with Celery Salad and Mustard Seed Vinaigrette</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-2Pxn4GmtYhU/VL7JC9SWZgI/AAAAAAAAUOo/tghkRrr0y8I/w955-h716-no/IMG_6290.JPG" alt="Eggplant Caponata"></p>

<p>My other lunch portion was Kyuri Zuke, Avocado, and Shiso Flake Maki, with Yuzu &amp; Pepper Edamame. Basically, a fancy way of saying pickled cucumber and avocado sushi rolls. Before today I’d probably have told you it’s not sushi without raw fish, old me was wrong, these were delicious.</p>

<p>I purchased a three month subscription from <a href="http://www.urthbox.com/">UrthBox</a> of healthy snacks. (Side note: I think UrthBox is good but expensive, they’ve had deals on Gilt City a lot lately) Quite a few were vegan. So I grabbed these fruit chews. </p>

<p>At first, I thought, “These aren’t much different than Starbursts!”. Then I found out, Starbursts aren’t vegan. Though some varieties appear not to have gelatin, it seems many incorporate Shellac in their confectioner’s glaze, which is derived from insects.</p>

<p>So given that, these were pretty fantastic.</p>

<p>J wanted to get out of the house for a little bit, so we went out and grabbed a quick dinner at a local indian fusion restaurant. They were super sweet and had tons of vegan options and substitutions. I ended up with a combo platter. Dark lighting but amazing meal.</p>

<p><strong>How did I feel?</strong> </p>

<p>I definitely wasn’t hungry. Granted, I basically almost ate two lunches, but I didn’t find myself missing meat</p>

<p><strong>Could I go Vegan?</strong></p>

<p>If I had a vegan friend group, or a vegan significant other, definitely. But I am unfortunately a person who caves to social pressure and I really, really love eating non-vegan deep dish pizza with J.</p>

<p><strong>What will I keep from Veganism?</strong></p>

<p>That breakfast was amazing and I can’t believe it took me this long to make. Also, I’d be more willing to grab a vegan entree at work.</p>

<p>Are you vegan? Could you do vegan? What good vegan eats did I miss out on?</p>

	<h1><a href="/1-28-2015/WIAW-sick.html">What I ate Wednesday, when I was sick.</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">

	</div>

	<p>I had a beautiful WIAW planned that was supposed to feature ingredients and plates that looked something like the picture above.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, when I woke up, I felt miserable. I could barely taste anything (such a waste), and my throat was scratchy and sore. And all my beautiful plans of nuts and other healthy fats were lost to ideas of soup and frozen drinks.</p>

<p>Being sick is hard enough, but trying to make decent food choices when you feel like your throat is made of sandpaper is quite the struggle. Between approximately 285 cups of tea, and a few shots of DayQuil, here’s <a href="//www.peasandcrayons.com">WIAW</a>.</p>

<p>I started the morning with a mango, orange, banana smoothie, and a bowl of apple cinnamon teff cereal. Having never had teff as a breakfast item, it&#39;s pretty close in taste to cream of wheat, or oatmeal. Its texture is much finer, almost like chia, or maybe even as fine as sand.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/UVSoTGXafWQwo_cmMrtKVUPipRdIgTVpqIGx63HfP7Ij=s716-no" alt=""><div class=caption></div></p>

<p>During lunch I made a break for the soup bar, after filling a bowl, I grabbed a plate of salad, sushi, and quinoa. Since you can&#39;t get Mom&#39;s chicken and dumpling (or noodle if you&#39;re a purist) when you&#39;re 2000 miles away, miso soup and some greens is about as good as it gets.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Odqw1ug7eRk/VMiaEPLgjUI/AAAAAAAAU4U/lcIl3ATrp9I/w1041-h605-no/15%2B-%2B2" alt=""></p>

<p>For snacks I headed to the juice bar, and grabbed a ginger and greens juice and some blueberry oatmeal bites. The bites didn’t really taste like much, but that may have been because I’m sick, or because the juice killed my pallette with a ginger bomb. I&#39;m kind of infatuated with my juice bar, the employees are always cheery, and mix the best drinks. I give them my ailment (DOMS, illness, 3pm fog), and they find me a juice. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Z2Gj4LM40HY/VMiaEN1gb6I/AAAAAAAAU34/OZKquYFxSTc/s716-no/15%2B-%2B4" alt=""></p>

<p>At the end of the night I grabbed Ramen with some friends. Hands down the best meal of the day. The spicyness made me forget I ever had sinuses, and the bowl came out so hot that it was basically a noodle sauna.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-xo8Bj1urVR8/VMiaEDTh69I/AAAAAAAAU3s/iIyWZk_Qcjo/w784-h716-no/15%2B-%2B5" alt=""></p>

<p>I&#39;ve got to tell you, I&#39;m so over being sick. When I was a kid, I remember having a light cold as being kind of fun. You got to stay home from school, watch TV, read, chill. Now, having a head cold just means I have to focus more to get my everything at work done, and I feel like I&#39;m wearing a perpetual nose plug, which makes eating, exercising, and talking so much fun. Sexy. I know.</p>

<p>How do you get over a cold? What&#39;s the best thing to eat when you&#39;re sick? :(</p>

	<h1><a href="/2-11-2015/WIAW-intuitive-eating.html">WIAW, Intuitive Eating</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		February 11, 2015
	</div>

	<p>It’s one of those weeks where <a href="//www.peasandcrayons.com">Wednesday</a> feels like Friday. Probably because I’m hopping a plane to Vegas tomorrow. Intuitive eating was the perfect eating experience to try to embody on a day where I felt like I had to micromanage every other aspect of my life.</p>

<p>While actual intuitive eating has a lot of components, and is much more than a day’s effort, I wanted to see how I would do if I just let myself eat when I decided I needed to. Each thing I ate will talk about how I felt about eating it.</p>

<p>Breakfast started a little different. I had two cranberry vegan pancakes, and decidedly non-vegan eggs. I walked to work this morning, and as someone who experiences morning hunger without even moving, I was pretty hungry when I got in.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/zEN_PEetcHlawpimCKGbyl25zvvnwTHIdq7KdfIKJzca=w955-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>How I felt: I had just walked two miles to work, I probably should have waited 15 minutes for my stomach to settle a bit more before eating to better gauge my hunger.</p>

<p>Lunch I didn’t have a lot of choice in, my coworkers and I eat together every day around noon. So even though I started feeling a little hungry at 11:30, this was the one meal I couldn’t go intuitive on.</p>

<p>We stopped at a bbq food truck, where I grabbed flank steak, whole wheat pasta with tomato and spinach, and a whole bunch of roasted broccoli.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/VFMNH3dAP9dITlQQqXHahAv7tkaMEpCj5tWtU_RvwcZi=w966-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>How I felt: I was definitely ready to eat by the time this came around, and I felt pretty nourished by this plate. </p>

<p>I had ⅓ of an apple fritter. A coworker came around with treats for his birthday, and two of my teammates and I split one. There’s no picture because I stood in a huge group, drinking coffee and celebrating a friend’s achievements. Sometimes, you can’t always snap what you ate.</p>

<p>How I felt: This was celebration food. I definitely wasn’t hungry at this point, but I didn’t indulge in an entire dessert myself, and it was the right move.</p>

<p>I grabbed another snack later in the day. Work has been stocking these bars, and they’re pretty much like healthy candy. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-MQlh0FAWbFw/VNr4O_2LOrI/AAAAAAAAWQM/Rbi3PSW_uD4/w538-h716-no/15%2B-%2B1" alt=""></p>

<p>How I felt: Honestly. I think I just grabbed one of these to have an excuse to get up from my desk. I love these, but I wasn’t hungry when I ate it.</p>

<p>I went for a run, biked home, and then J and I spent the evening cleaning. At the end of the night after a bunch of sweat, bleach, and exhaustion, I just wasn’t hungry. I grabbed a handful of See’s Hot Hearts. (These are like the best Hot Tamales I’ve ever had, and cinnamon candy is difficult for me to go overboard on.)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/p786qXmuxPlSNHPNp_prnJA4qJCz2RB_lMWUjXDS6Mf3=s716-no" alt=""><div class="caption">Please enjoy my kitchen tile, straight from the 70s.</div> </p>

<p>How I felt: I probably didn’t need these, I was mostly tired, not very hungry.</p>

<p>I think I’m better at identifying food I am hungry for, and food I’m craving than I give myself credit for. I definitely ate a bunch of sugary things today, more than I usually shoot for, but overall it wasn’t terrible.</p>

<p>I’d love to eventually transition over to a more intuitive style of eating, but right now, I do live, and like living with some food rules. So we’ll see.</p>

<p>Do you eat intuitively? What’s the best thing you ate recently?</p>
