	<p>Ever find something decidedly cool, from an incredibly uncool place? J and I found out about Lazy Bear, an underground dinner you sign up for lottery style a few months ago. After months of putting our names in, we finally were chosen for this many many course experience. We thought we were cool, and hip, and maybe read it in the New York Times, or heard it from a food loving friend. </p>

<p>But no. It was Yelp. The number one rated “restaurant” in SF. Not so cool. The courses were all amazing, and there are so many, that I won’t describe every one in detail.</p>

<p>Let’s begin. I missed snapping photos of some of the initial courses, so, this is not representative of the full meal.</p>

	<p>I have to say, while I usually don’t love looking at my own mediocre pictures of food that I secretly take while (I hope) my coworkers aren’t looking. I get some perverse joy out of seeing what other people are eating, and so in that, I have to indulge you in my Wednesday food lineup. If you too love looking at what others are eating check out <a href="http://peasandcrayons.com/">more here</a>.</p>

<p>This is food no filter. So what I ate, I snapped. Basically, all my meals are provided by my workplace. So I’m a little constrained with what I eat.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/TJJMFn1QlUzjpfCuBH3DXkXqBDnOY3uJ0lLhYfVIBFA=w890-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Breakfast is usually fruit + eggs or cottage cheese. (Plus a giant coffee, black). This is just the most simple meal that will tide me over until lunch. I have this basically every day but Friday. :)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-MfHRSq3-7l4/VEgCW9NYkEI/AAAAAAAAMSE/H7LNXJd4D2A/w955-h716-no/IMG_4034.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>We had a food truck here today that served salads!</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-aSb6075UWVw/VEgCeFI6DhI/AAAAAAAAMTA/pe7EZep8nlY/w955-h716-no/IMG_4039.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Tuna poke salad with carrots, cucumbers, brown rice and a miso dressing. Super delicious but, way too much rice. My bowl looked like this at the end of lunch:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-52GhPzAC0A4/VEgEF-Cx3pI/AAAAAAAAMUs/7N5S-KdmzGs/w875-h716-no/IMG_4040.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>I’m a person who lives off of snacks. So in the afternoon, I had a little of:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-pU8tj7pG63c/VEfmprnQHvI/AAAAAAAAMUQ/0ZaKsmMxD3w/w604-h716-no/IMG_4028.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>And some of</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/XgrbgZ6rEWWi411MZwXCIOK0VHmQmccHA2lUm-TxMfQ=w537-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>I’m not much of a dinner person, so taking one from Oliva Pope, I’ll be having a bowl of popcorn, but no wine. I’d snap a picture, but I haven’t eaten it yet.</p>

<p>Over all, I’d probably like to add some more vegetables to my day, and maybe a little protein. I’m hoping to pick up some Quest bars on the suggestion of a friend, because while my body handles sugar substitutes pretty well, I become a maniac on sugar. Maybe next Wednesday I’ll throw in a real salad. :)</p>

<p>In true form, I can’t end this post without this awesome and hilariously flattering selfie I took and then applied a million filters to this morning. My toggling with weird image settings game is getting so strong.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-UoHEEtxeCSk/VEfmnrmhYlI/AAAAAAAAMU0/tiR8ErMnqQk/w438-h716-no/IMG_4026.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>I know pumpkin is like the it food of the month. I obviously need to work on my pumpkin game. Have you been indulging in any fall favorites?</p>

	<p>Do you ever wonder what people will think of us in 500 years? I had this exact thought this morning. What would a cultural anthropologist a few hundred years from now think of the fact that every Wednesday, a bunch of people post stylized pictures of what they ate that day? </p>

<p>In spite of the fact that researchers in the future will probably think I’m part of a weird food posting cult, and also judge me for eating packaged eggs. I’m still here to report on the things I ate on my <a href="http://peasandcrayons.com/">Wednesday</a>. </p>

<p>Here goes breakfast. Coffee. Kiwi. And the Wilcox bag? That’s two hardboiled eggs. They’re delicious. Judge away.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/bzQ_TbxCbziq7eDjXDYVQxKDznYG3LyNeJ90AoZjHqk=w873-h726-no" alt="Breakfast"></p>

<p>Pardon the lunch shot. I’m still not quite comfortable announcing to my coworkers that I’m going to be photographing my food. But I made a grilled veggie and chicken sandwich and paired it with a macaroni and chickpea soup in a vegetable-tomato broth.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ZezR8-0q7r_o2tyq6jWolba07qwWW2sDypdqDf87av4=w873-h655-no" alt=""></p>

<p>This apple doesn’t look anywhere to actual scale of an apple. But it was my post lunch snack.</p>

<p>Work brought around these cups of chia seed pudding. They were unreal. Diced mango, chia seeds, coconut milk, agave, and mint. Delicious. I may or may not try to recreate this it was so good.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/R33nSfWkH7PN0zsngTEE6oCGWseqWDatIarqpq7ECuc=s873-no" alt="Chia pudding"></p>

<p>It’s not dinner yet here. But I’ll probably snack on something at home. I’m not a big late meal person. I tend to sleep better when I eat less at night.</p>

<p>What&#39;s your current snacking fave? I&#39;m looking for something new. All my summer snacks seem <em>so wrong</em> when we&#39;re approaching winter. </p>
