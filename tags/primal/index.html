	<p>A few weeks ago, I challenged myself to explore different diets on <a href="http://peasandcrayons.com/2015/02/ate-wednesday-211-feed-seymour.html">WIAW</a>. One of the main reasons I wanted to take on more diverse eating styles for WIAW, was to shake up my current routine. Trying <a href="http://www.kaybueno.com/1-21-2015/vegan-WIAW.html">vegan</a> was great, but it was already an eating style I was relatively comfortable with, and one that my current lifestyle and workplace made easy.</p>

<p>This week I was inspired by the Paleo/Primal/Keto diets out there. Now. I say inspired because I think it’s naive to think I can read about a way of eating, emulate it for a day, and really understand the workings. If you follow <a href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/">Mark’s Daily Apple</a>, <a href="http://robbwolf.com/">Robb Wolf</a>, or even <a href="http://paleomg.com/">PaleOMG</a>, you’re going to get a much more developed view of these diets. For me, I just wanted to shuck routine, and maybe even find a new eating style I was better suited to.</p>

<p>I had to prep a lot for this week, and I didn’t even finish all the prep I wanted to. I took a lot of inspiration from <a href="https://ieatirunblog.wordpress.com/2014/08/04/recipe-nut-bombs-primal-fruit-parfait/">IEatIRun</a>.</p>

<p>I started with a twist on her nut bombs. (I was out of almonds). Which are pretty similar to most of the energy bites out there. Even post paleo experimenting, I’ve been eating these on a regular basis. Enough to have made them twice now. </p>

<p>Breakfast was also an IEatIRun rip off. I made a coconut cream parfait, with crumbled nut bombs, a few sliced strawberries and coconut cream from <a href="http://cookeatpaleo.com/how-to-make-coconut-whipped-cream/">this recipe</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/QzlnUACF12QKFkfgG_a_6lzSps2TQc4E4rOn5VR0tgdB=w868-h716-no" alt="breakfast"></p>

<p>For lunch I was stuck with what was at work. When consulting with a friend who eats Paleo at the same company, he told me his biggest issue was finding food that wasn’t cooked in canola oil. Fortunately, I got lucky with olive oil ahi tuna, a salad, and zucchini dressed in an avocado, citrus, and olive oil dressing.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-TmTTKcy45to/VNG1RjQA9RI/AAAAAAAAVP0/s9pe8iac0OI/w962-h716-no/15%2B-%2B4" alt="lunch"></p>

<p>I was swamped with work until dinner, but I had brought nut bombs in case I couldn’t find a reasonable snack. I popped one before and Iyengar yoga class. (A good stretch, but not my beloved Vinyasa.)</p>

<p>For dinner, I grabbed a pesto chicken breast, smothered it in a chipotle salsa, and had a side salad and guacamole. I don’t know why I don’t eat this dinner more often...</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/jE1J_zJ2v5Hhtx2BmqBuuiS4EE8hXpRbQHhk7fPF1sUi=w964-h716-no" alt="dinner"></p>

<p>Overall, this was definitely a blast, and definitely out of my usual element for food choices. I had to be a little more discerning. I&#39;d love to up my paleo trend to a week, or a month, but I have a few consistent meals that don&#39;t really fit right now. So I&#39;ll have to get to planning.</p>

<p>Do you eat paleo? Have you ever tried it?</p>
