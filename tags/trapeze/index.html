	<p>Two years ago. I didn’t have any hobbies. None. Not because I was busy, or because I had just moved, but because I couldn’t stomach the fact that I might look dumb doing something. </p>

<p>I was incredibly insecure. I thought that I needed to look effortless, and attractive, and cool, all the time. And that meant not taking on anything new, because I wasn&#39;t sure I could do it perfectly. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/8IbkLAUgzB56G4c9PAqYeZOxeBnXrUFXAdN-UzBjFVIN=w794-h706-no" alt="dranks with the roomies"></p>

<p>(This is probably what I thought cool looked like.)</p>

<p>In the event I did end up out of my comfort zone, I wasn’t good at it, I’d just quit. I know, real winning attitude there. It was terrible for me, and probably worse for the people I was around. </p>

<p>And I might not have ever really tried anything if I didn’t accidentally stumble upon a hobby I loved.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Z8yQO85-AX8/VK4VSw64e0I/AAAAAAAATA0/EwLzC8jKEi8/w960-h637-no/trapeze1.jpg" alt="trapeze"></p>

<p>Flying trapeze. </p>

<p>I finally wanted to be good at something so badly, I was willing to be bad at it to do so. Flying trapeze was the greatest high (literally) I had ever had, and I was addicted. I was also terrible. I&#39;m inflexible, and tall, and altogether difficult person to catch. But it was amazing. And being bad at trapeze was the best thing that happened to me.</p>

<p>I figured, once I was a total novice at one thing. Why not make a fool of myself doing all the things I wished I could do?</p>

<p>So I started running. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/q250TjR-a9ZNhekEpN1N6TxDN3MUUNFaQ__vIcC4hwqA=w955-h716-no" alt="running"></p>

<p>And yoga.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/KIMoLaHs688VGrCvkLkCL9w6CLFj_7Sayvbhyb3OWGV7=w932-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Today. Am I the best at any of these things? </p>

<p>Not even close. I run 9-10 minute miles, I&#39;m just now able to touch the floor in a forward fold, and I&#39;m still the slowest trapeze student to pick up new tricks. I read the most amazing blogs of friends who are spin instructors, serious yogis, competitive runners, and I think &quot;Oh god, what am I doing here?&quot;</p>

<p>But even as an inflexible, kind of slow student, I&#39;m the happiest me I&#39;ve ever been. I&#39;ve stopped comparing myself to others. I&#39;m much better at celebrating achievements, and I let myself try anything.</p>

<p>With the New Year rolling around, and goals being on everyone&#39;s mind, I want to remind you that you are more than the things you&#39;re good at, and it&#39;s worth trying anything you want to do even if you fail fantastically at it. I would have never run a half, or swung tricks out of lines if I didn&#39;t allow myself to be bad at things first.</p>

<p>In the immortal words of the cartoon show Adventure Time:</p>

<p>“Dude, suckin’ at something is the first step to being sorta good at something”.</p>

<p>What do you suck at?</p>
