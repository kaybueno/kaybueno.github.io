	<p>Living in SF gives you more of an excuse to jet off to Hawaii. It&#39;s closer than New York, Boston, and Florida, and despite crossing an ocean, you don&#39;t have to suffer through customs.</p>

<p>I went recently on a three day &quot;work&quot; trip. Which is to say that work paid for the trip, but I (nor my teammates) didn&#39;t actually get any work done. </p>

<p>My team stayed at the Kaanapali Westin in Maui. The resort was kind of faux exotic. When you entered there was this giant manmade waterfalls that they had trapped a variety of wild birds and koi in. So that when you exited checkin you were greeted by flamingos and macaws chilling under a giant waterfall. It&#39;s definitely bizarre, and seemed a little trying too hard. (But yo, I still took pictures of it)</p>

<p>Hawaii is a vacation spot that doesn&#39;t take much work if you&#39;re coming from the mainland. Everyone speaks the same language, your GPS works, and you don&#39;t really have to do much to have fun. While it&#39;s nice for relaxing, it can be almost too effortless. Given the lax environment, I spent a lot of my time walking along the beach, reading outside in perfect weather and just chilling.</p>

<p>I just recently moved to a new team at work, and wanted to impress my coworkers and meet people. So I probably tried too hard. I was extroverted, stayed out late, danced, introduced myself to everyone and basically made sure I met everyone. It was a nice mix of work (meeting everyone in the world, omg.) and play (laying on the beach and people watching)</p>

<p>Ultimately I got in my two favorite things in Hawaii, Acai Bowls (omg, learned to make these at home. Going to eat them forever.) and Surfing (also should do this at home, buuuuut.)</p>
