	<p>I love the feeling of anticipation right up until I have to take the first step. During the morning, I dream about running, until I hit the moment where I need to lace up my shoes and take off. When I’m just ready to go, I hit that initial dread of the activity. What if it goes wrong? What if I hate it?</p>

<p>So it’s no surprise that now, the night before I embark on a primarily liquid diet, that I feel that ache in the pit of my stomach. Unboxing soylent. Beautiful. Showing the packaging off to my boyfriend, amazing. But as I go to eat my “last supper”, I feel uneasy. </p>

<p>I received my shipment of soylent last week. And because I’d like to pretend my life demands fanfare, I refused to begin a liquid diet on a Thursday, because as any yo-yo dieter knows, diets must begin on a Monday, to give you the entire weekend to binge and feel bad about your choices.</p>

<p>Soylent comes in a ~2000 calorie pack, and advertises ideal nutrition. As I’m a woman, and relatively sedentary, I plan on experimenting with my calorie intake until I find a good medium. Ideally somewhere between 1000-1500, depending on my activity levels.</p>

<p>All this said, I’m still a social person, and I plan on eating normal food over the weekends so my boyfriend isn’t driven insane by my food experimenting, and hopefully so I can’t ruin my digestive system (and other body systems?) too much.</p>

<p>At least I have until tomorrow.</p>

	<p>Before I tried Soylent, I read about it everywhere. As much as I could. But reading about it was unfulfilling because all of the descriptions are so bland… so neutral…</p>

<p>But I get it now! When I got home, it was almost easier to describe what Soylent wasn’t, than what it was. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-6mLCc2lqXWo/U-mSipjQmTI/AAAAAAAAG78/nEnEh1WTcLA/w955-h716-no/IMG_2689.JPG" alt="Measuring my day of food"></p>

<p>Like, you know how when you eat food, and it’s your favorite food. The way you eat is happy, the act of consuming is an exciting moment. And you&#39;re like super happy. In your eating. It’s a good food experience.</p>

<p>But like, you can also have really bad food experiences. You can eat something gross, or something you’re not in the mood for, and you honestly don’t want another bite. It’s a negative food experience.</p>

<p>Soylent is neither of these. I found myself taking sips to keep myself from getting hungry (something I quickly noticed if I got too focused in my work and forgot to drink). But I was neither repulsed or excited to eat more. It’s pretty late at night and I’m only a little more than 2/3rds of the way through 1000 calories of Soylent. But I just sip at it every 20-30 minutes or so.</p>

<p>I did eat real food today though to ease in. Two apples. One first thing in the morning, and one at 5 pm. I want to make sure my digestive tract doesn’t freak out on me. </p>

<p>Overall it went, well. No reason to be nervous. Granted, everything is easiest the first day. Everything but posting these pictures!</p>

<p>I hate putting these late night “Before” pictures up, but I want to track my progress and see how soylent affects my overall body. So pardon the awkward photos we snapped at midnight last night. But hopefully, these not so sexy shots will lead to some great afters. :)</p>

<p>Total today ~1240 calories</p>
