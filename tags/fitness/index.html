	<h1><a href="/10-23-2014/motivation.html">What’s your motivation?</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		October 23, 2014
	</div>

	<p>At 5:30 pm, after a 9 hour day of standing (I have a lovely standing desk), looking at a computer screen, and typing, the last thing I want to do is go run, or exercise in general.</p>

<p>And then my brain starts telling me. “Oh, you don’t need to run. You have… work. You’re… tired. You could… spend this time better.” And it takes a lot of work, some will power and a few tricks to get myself here:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/3f1JmkMPH6r8vXm5xiiDYymZwE3rDdIYEdxI9f6XLKg=w955-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>(Seriously this is one of the few times I cared enough in the morning to put on matching socks. Usually I have like, one lime sock and one purple one.)</p>

<p>I’ve been working on a few tricks to get myself to keep ignoring the lazy person inside of me:</p>

<h2>1. Buy myself things for doing exercise</h2>

<p>Childish perhaps. And consumeristic, but very effective. Usually, I set some sort of goal, like: “Exercise 5 days this week”. This week (given I work out tomorrow) I’m buying </p>

<p><a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/167820434/day-of-the-dead-boston-terrier-sugar"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-piTRIVkYqxQ/VEm-JxvgxFI/AAAAAAAAMVw/FLjZze7szn0/w570-h544-no/diadelosdog.jpg" alt=""></a></p>

<h2>2. Keep everything I need to workout at my desk</h2>

<p>Everyone in my building has a little file cabinet. And while most people keep extra work supplies in them (one of my coworkers keeps his full of listerine), I keep a bunch of shirts, a spare pair of tennis shoes, socks and hairbands in them. So I can always get from work appropriate to workout appropriate.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-KEi93M6r840/U-KsUJ8tcrI/AAAAAAAAE2k/H9NScVWwhrc/w537-h716-no/IMG_1863.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>(Things I wouldn’t mind putting in my file cabinet. If I had more money, and I trekked up the the Nike store more often.)</p>

<h2>3. Brag</h2>

<p>No one likes the self righteous exerciser. But I have a few key friends who put up with my boasting because they know if I keep up on staying fit, I’m a more sane person. And I’m always open to them when they want to hit me up about their latest sweat sesh.</p>

<p>Even with all of this, sometimes fitness still falls by the wayside. What’s your trick to keeping motivated?</p>

	<h1><a href="/11-13-2014/sweat-republic-surf-set-review.html">Sweat Republic Surf Set Review</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		November 13, 2014
	</div>

	<p>I was a kid who should have been born on the water. Every time I’ve been to the ocean, for surfing, stand-up paddle boarding, or just swimming, I’ve had a blast. Maybe even the best time of my life. Unfortunately, thanks to a midwest upbringing, skin that burns at the slightest hint of sun, and the serious cost of ocean activities, I’ve never been able to actually improve my surf skills after the initial lesson.</p>

<p>Enter Surf Set.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Hlg3axFxiPtkNIElZuHBnwmIwLrx2x6tXBrQN4Eb1jA=w1038-h657-no" alt=""></p>

<p>For those of you who haven’t heard of it before, Surf Set is pretty much like surfing on land. (A lovely experience for those of us who want to avoid burns, uncomfortable wet suits, and sharks). A surf board balanced on three, bosu-like balls, mimics the instability of the ocean. The class lets you practice both moves necessary to improve surfing, but also other non-traditional strength, cardio, and flexibility building moves.</p>

<p><a href="http://almostgettingittogether.com/surfset-review/">Cassie</a> and I went to a morning Surf Set class, at a super cute studio called <a href="http://sweatrepublicsf.com/">Sweat Republic</a>, and fell in love.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-mfYYDvf6rLY/VGAsnKEbw2I/AAAAAAAAN0E/eos1EQB8u-w/w955-h716-no/IMG_0482.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Excuse the extreme cheesing and the incorrect hand positioning. I need some more classes under my belt before I look good doing this. :)</p>

<p>The instructor was extremely friendly, and took a lot of time coming around to help correct poses, challenge students, and even help me jump from the ground onto a surfboard. It turns out she was actually a surfer, which reinforced the fact that this may actually help if I ever get on the water again.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-SlD3yMuCT2U/VGAsjSAjK8I/AAAAAAAANzI/LzGpNT_CYRM/w955-h716-no/IMG_0474.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>The class began with a quick warm up, which was primarily comprised of on the ground stretching.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-PTvGEiI4jvo/VGAsinyw29I/AAAAAAAAN0w/raeZdMXIxW0/w955-h716-no/IMG_0473.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>We worked our way through cardio, strength training, balancing, and a mock surf session in the hour long class. While I definitely sweat some, I felt it most the next day in my obliques. Balancing and stability are good for the abs. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-O9CprsRrpvU/VGAshU5weGI/AAAAAAAAN0c/EJRvwyrHyP0/w955-h716-no/IMG_0471.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>I had such an amazing time. Sometimes, when I read about classes in San Francisco, and they say “All Levels”, I interpret that as “All levels of people who are already physically fit”. </p>

<p>As someone who has a little bit of performance anxiety This class was actually “All Levels”, there are a bunch of different ways to customize both the difficulty of the boards, and the moves involved to make it work for you. The class went by super fast, and I can&#39;t wait to go again this weekend.</p>

<p>Would you surf on land? What crazy fitness class do I need to find next in San Francisco?</p>

	<h1><a href="/2-3-2015/new-workouts.html">My New Workouts</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		February 3, 2015
	</div>

	<p>At the beginning of the year, I <a href="http://www.kaybueno.com/1-1-2015/resolutions.html">challenged myself</a> to quite a few fitness feats.</p>

<p>Last year I achieved a lot in terms of flexibility, and running. I completed my first half marathon, and regular yoga sessions have helped me feel almost bendy and stretchy. But even with improvements there, I’ve been incredibly deficient when it comes to strength. I can barely do a couple of solid push ups, and I’m nowhere near my dream goal. One pull up.</p>

<p>So I’ve been working through some plyometric circuits to improve strength. So far, I’ve been really really ridiculously sore. (But happy!) While I’m not ready for heavy weights yet. (I think this is the road to weight lifting addiction). This has been my current set up.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-FJ1Rh5fkjv0/VNBmipn6lkI/AAAAAAAAVLE/CjmF3ss754A/w699-h716-no/IMG_6541.JPG" alt=""><div class="caption">The bare necessities.</div></p>

<p>I end up doing about 30 minutes of circuits. Today focused on legs, and had a bunch of squats, lunges, box step-ups, and jumping. While I still feel like a goon during the workout, I was much smoother, and less tired this week.</p>

<p>My biggest dilemma right now, is that, in order to fit this in along with my other training, it means I’m working out twice a day, five days a week. Which might not be too bad, except that work has been pretty swamped lately. The reason I have a giant exercise room to myself in these pictures is because I’m working out at 9pm. Well after most people have left the office.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-5ywotTF0G1A/VNBmjgHDTtI/AAAAAAAAVLM/BBFgjkXUpm4/w955-h716-no/IMG_6542.JPG" alt=""><div class="caption">My least favorite part. The jump rope. 5 year old me is disappointed.</div></p>

<p>Right now, I do both “activities” at night. After the gym clears out, and once my work is done. If I could, I’d love to do a morning session, and an evening session, but I can’t find any way to swing that with my schedule. (The extra morning shower is what kills it!) So lately, I’ve just been trying to hit both workouts, and if I don’t. Well. I don’t.</p>

<p>On the bright side, I’m really loving the plyometric workouts. While I hate every minute of them while I’m doing them. I kind of missed being this sore. (Is that weird, it’s weird?) And I feel better balanced fitting them in.</p>

<p>My other favorite part? They fit anywhere. Which is super convenient because I’m meeting my sister in Vegas in 10 days! </p>

<p>When and where do you workout? What types of exercises are your favorite?</p>
