	<h1><a href="/1-21-2015/vegan-WIAW.html">What I ate Wednesday, Vegan Exploration!</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		January 21, 2015
	</div>

	<p><a href="http://www.kaybueno.com/1-14-2015/WIAW.html">Last week</a>, I felt like my WIAW were becoming predictable. I think if I took another picture of oatmeal, or bagged eggs, my iPhone camera was going to revolt. In order to keep my sanity, and make sure my camera roll wasn’t full up of the same pictures shot every Tuesday. I decided to try different eating styles for <a href="//www.peasandcrayons.com">WIAW</a>.</p>

<p>This Wednesday I decided to explore what it’s like to be a Vegan. Obviously, doing something for one day doesn’t produce a lot of mindblowing outcomes, and there’s no before/after. I figured it would get me out of a food rut and make me try something new. My goal was to not show you my usual week made vegan, but to try to go “all in” and pick the food I felt best fit the diet. </p>

<p>Today, I ran in late after helping bandage up J’s wounds, so I didn’t have time to grab breakfast from a cafe. It was a little hard to avoid the call of eggs and yogurt, my usual morning staples. But I found a perfectly ripe banana and some Justin’s and combined.</p>

<p>I only have the before picture, but I cut the banana in half and spread the peanut butter inside. Enough of my co-workers walked by and joked that I didn’t have a future in surgery, so you just get this:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-YHWB5kyPtD0/VL7tpPMqSxI/AAAAAAAAUTs/J9xnVuuzGYs/w600-h500-no/15%2B-%2B1" alt="banana and peanut butter"></p>

<p>One of my concerns about taking a vegan day at work was that I’d spend the day eating side dishes, and never feel full. Fortunately, I found a cafe that had quite a few solid vegan entrees. I’m terrible at deciding, so I picked two dishes, figuring I could just eat half of each.</p>

<p>I ate all of both.</p>

<p>The first was an Eggplant Caponata, Pine Nuts, and Whole Wheat Pita with Celery Salad and Mustard Seed Vinaigrette</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-2Pxn4GmtYhU/VL7JC9SWZgI/AAAAAAAAUOo/tghkRrr0y8I/w955-h716-no/IMG_6290.JPG" alt="Eggplant Caponata"></p>

<p>My other lunch portion was Kyuri Zuke, Avocado, and Shiso Flake Maki, with Yuzu &amp; Pepper Edamame. Basically, a fancy way of saying pickled cucumber and avocado sushi rolls. Before today I’d probably have told you it’s not sushi without raw fish, old me was wrong, these were delicious.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/--avHlV6xRKo/VL7yQU69NfI/AAAAAAAAUVI/ksJR4fGuG_M/w600-h500-no/15%2B-%2B1" alt="sushi"></p>

<p>I purchased a three month subscription from <a href="http://www.urthbox.com/">UrthBox</a> of healthy snacks. (Side note: I think UrthBox is good but expensive, they’ve had deals on Gilt City a lot lately) Quite a few were vegan. So I grabbed these fruit chews. </p>

<p>At first, I thought, “These aren’t much different than Starbursts!”. Then I found out, Starbursts aren’t vegan. Though some varieties appear not to have gelatin, it seems many incorporate Shellac in their confectioner’s glaze, which is derived from insects.</p>

<p>So given that, these were pretty fantastic.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-rQKxx_SyzPE/VL7sX61WhyI/AAAAAAAAUSs/Rfd8fTZpNi0/s640-no/15%2B-%2B1" alt="fruit chews"></p>

<p>J wanted to get out of the house for a little bit, so we went out and grabbed a quick dinner at a local indian fusion restaurant. They were super sweet and had tons of vegan options and substitutions. I ended up with a combo platter. Dark lighting but amazing meal.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/sWpSt-G6-5mTKl8sD_QWI1Mu-J9ZC7T8l1b39BdXYqkk=w600-h500-no" alt="dinner"></p>

<p><strong>How did I feel?</strong> </p>

<p>I definitely wasn’t hungry. Granted, I basically almost ate two lunches, but I didn’t find myself missing meat</p>

<p><strong>Could I go Vegan?</strong></p>

<p>If I had a vegan friend group, or a vegan significant other, definitely. But I am unfortunately a person who caves to social pressure and I really, really love eating non-vegan deep dish pizza with J.</p>

<p><strong>What will I keep from Veganism?</strong></p>

<p>That breakfast was amazing and I can’t believe it took me this long to make. Also, I’d be more willing to grab a vegan entree at work.</p>

<p>Are you vegan? Could you do vegan? What good vegan eats did I miss out on?</p>

	<h1><a href="/1-26-2015/weekend-eats.html">A weekend of eats!</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		January 26, 2015
	</div>

	<p>Thanks so much for all your sympathy over the crash! J has mostly received tough love from his manly roommates, and so it was nice to read all your lovely comments to him.</p>

<p>This weekend was the least vain weekend of all time, I managed to take almost no photos of myself. Partially because I was home, helping take care of J, and not out adventuring, and partially because I spent most of my weekend eating really delicious food.</p>

<p>Saturday night I went out with <a href="//www.almostgettingittogether.com">Cassie</a>, to Cha-ya. It’s a vegetarian/vegan Japanese restaurant that is so hole-in-the-wall, it doesn’t even have a website. Which may be the norm for non-chain restaurants in a lot of cities, but even the <a href="http://www.letsbefrankdogs.com/">grass fed hotdog stand</a> in my neighborhood has it’s own site. So not being on the internet here is kind of a big deal.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-xtckJoAjNhc/VMXtbycCoKI/AAAAAAAAUcY/pUCfBCa8eTo/s716-no/IMG_6355.JPG" alt=""><div class="caption">My suggestion? Order avocado everything.</div></p>

<p>Sunday night I met up with a friend to try out a Rhythm and Motion dance class. It was quite an adventure, primarily because I barely have rhythm, and mostly have motion. My biggest takeaway? I totally underestimated dancers, I was dripping in sweat by end.</p>

<p>I know I probably shouldn’t take on more things, but I really loved the class and might continue to go on Sunday nights. Can you pick up dance if you’re only doing it one night a week?</p>

<p>After class we met up with another friend and cooked dinner. Or really, to be fair, they cooked me dinner. It was phenomenal, and I apologize that my pictures don&#39;t do it any justice. I was too focused on enjoying the company and the candlelight to take good photos.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/CVE_vrsa_m7WGU8LJMyxwpKCCMqdbzhGaWKI8i5ca4xK=w958-h716-no" alt=""><div class="caption">Frisee salad with bacon, poached egg, and a bacon mustard vinaigrette.</div></p>

<p>We planned the dinner around my friend who is doing keto (with some serious success!) I was mostly impressed with how delicious keto is. Yum. Bacon. Egg. Cheese. Yum.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-6-ji7SCwjuA/VMXvNKLtZjI/AAAAAAAAUgg/zFMsWyMB96c/w955-h716-no/15%2B-%2B1" alt=""><div class="caption">Roasted chicken with a roasted cauliflower and broccolini done “mac &amp; cheese” style.</div></p>

<p>This is one of the first times I’ve been convinced you can cook better at home than in a restaurant. Everything was amazing.</p>

<p>The cutest picture of my weekend? A sleepy great dane I ran into on a walk I did. He, or maybe she, was chilling in the front of a designer eyewear shop. Makes me miss my mom’s dog. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-5MEWODkUSvg/VMXtQl9ogoI/AAAAAAAAUas/dS4syAxWnpQ/w955-h716-no/IMG_6340.JPG" alt=""><div class="caption">San Francisco&#39;s dog population isn&#39;t helping my puppy fever.</div></p>

<p>How was your weekend? What should I do about the dance class? How often do you work out in a week?</p>

	<h1><a href="/2-25-2015/WIAW.html">WIAW - Vegan before a Cleanse</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		February 25, 2015
	</div>

	<p>Between you and me, I’ve never done a juice cleanse before. I like eating, and I’m not always a fan of how juice cleanses are marketed. I think my liver does a fine job of getting rid of toxins, and I’m not sure I really need to detox anything.</p>

<p>But, I have wanted to try one, with a juice bar on every corner in SF, it’s hard to not wonder. And I don’t think my metabolism, and body are so fragile that 3 days of 1200 calories in juice will hurt much.</p>

<p>Cleanses are kind of expensive (even with the deal I used), and so I wanted to do it “right”. So this whole week I’ve been eating vegan, and getting progressively more restrictive with my diet. The makers suggest “you cut out alcohol, processed foods, excess salt, white flour and bread products, and refined sugar a day or two before the program and load up on fresh fruits and veggies.”</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Bpl8pAQtyQDPfkk6Eo-5t-sw0yZp_tCq13IGK3yMLkYo=s1023-no" alt=""></p>

<p>For breakfast I made some coconut chia seed pudding (coconut milk, chia seeds, a drop of agave), and sprinkled a bit of this granola on for crunch. Delicious.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-9U7954KSTq8/VO3mJkm1N7I/AAAAAAAAXfg/uOvZMDLg2A8/w1022-h767-no/IMG_7300.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Lazy lunch. A veggie sandwich with spinach, onion, tomato, avocado and mustard. And a tofu and tomato soup. I’m lucky that work labels all their vegan options, but man, it’s kind of difficult to find things that don’t feel like sides. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-fAteehmqwSU/VO3mKEjiZXI/AAAAAAAAXfg/G9zLuilI6_k/w1023-h767-no/IMG_7299.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Post lunch snack of coconut chips, and hot tea. I’ve been drinking a lot of herbal tea during this in order to cut down my carbonated beverages problem.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/FqGghkNq0zOSvryeynP5uWPEqfR8jNBAv4VJ4qdKTb6N=w1023-h1165-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Desk picture of these super delicious bean chips. They’re very reminiscent of doritos, complete with seasoning that ends up all over your hands. I really loved them.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bqsfjeWsL9gNhpQY6FzR_ExSJ8KkRjMnsLUqg7_vs6Mp=w1023-h994-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Black bean brownie bites I made from <a href="http://minimalistbaker.com/vegan-gluten-free-black-bean-brownies/">this recipe</a> but with coconut sugar instead of raw cane. I added the sprinkles when photographing otherwise they look like bean hockey pucks. They’re good, but they definitely taste “healthy”. Whenever people tell me their friends can’t tell the difference, I always wonder if they have really polite, or really healthy friends. I’d eat these at home, but I wouldn’t bring them to a party.</p>

<p>Unpictured are the handful of cashews I snarfed. I had a hard time with vegan food this time. I’m used to a lot of protein, and I think not having easy options for protein made me ravenous and freezing cold all day. I paired a small dish of the chia seed pudding with a brownie this morning for breakfast and feel much better. So I&#39;m just aiming to eat more beans, nuts and tofu today.</p>

<p>It’s fun to try vegan, especially while J isn’t around. </p>

<p>Have you tried a cleanse? What vegan food should I try out?</p>
