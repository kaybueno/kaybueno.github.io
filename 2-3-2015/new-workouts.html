	<h1><a href="">My New Workouts</a></h1>

	<p>At the beginning of the year, I <a href="http://www.kaybueno.com/1-1-2015/resolutions.html">challenged myself</a> to quite a few fitness feats.</p>

<p>Last year I achieved a lot in terms of flexibility, and running. I completed my first half marathon, and regular yoga sessions have helped me feel almost bendy and stretchy. But even with improvements there, I’ve been incredibly deficient when it comes to strength. I can barely do a couple of solid push ups, and I’m nowhere near my dream goal. One pull up.</p>

<p>So I’ve been working through some plyometric circuits to improve strength. So far, I’ve been really really ridiculously sore. (But happy!) While I’m not ready for heavy weights yet. (I think this is the road to weight lifting addiction). This has been my current set up.</p>

<p>I end up doing about 30 minutes of circuits. Today focused on legs, and had a bunch of squats, lunges, box step-ups, and jumping. While I still feel like a goon during the workout, I was much smoother, and less tired this week.</p>

<p>My biggest dilemma right now, is that, in order to fit this in along with my other training, it means I’m working out twice a day, five days a week. Which might not be too bad, except that work has been pretty swamped lately. The reason I have a giant exercise room to myself in these pictures is because I’m working out at 9pm. Well after most people have left the office.</p>

<p>Right now, I do both “activities” at night. After the gym clears out, and once my work is done. If I could, I’d love to do a morning session, and an evening session, but I can’t find any way to swing that with my schedule. (The extra morning shower is what kills it!) So lately, I’ve just been trying to hit both workouts, and if I don’t. Well. I don’t.</p>

<p>On the bright side, I’m really loving the plyometric workouts. While I hate every minute of them while I’m doing them. I kind of missed being this sore. (Is that weird, it’s weird?) And I feel better balanced fitting them in.</p>

<p>My other favorite part? They fit anywhere. Which is super convenient because I’m meeting my sister in Vegas in 10 days! </p>

<p>When and where do you workout? What types of exercises are your favorite?</p>
