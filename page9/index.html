	<p>I’ve never been the type of person to have a ton of school spirit, or any type of spirit. I wasn’t the kid who dressed up for football games, or Halloween, or events or conventions. I don’t begrudge those who do, on the contrary. I’m a little jealous. I wish I could put something amazing together for every holiday, and pull it off. </p>

<p>Fortunately, J’s the same. Except, this year we had a Halloween party that we had to have costumes for. And I found this out… 2 days before. So I threw together a costume of things I had in my house.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/prZ9iCOhLt60TCYlLsDZykOuOJoIgOeQT8kFXvuMY7s=w493-h716-no" alt="K costume"></p>

<p>A white t-shirt, brown eyeshadow, lipstick, food coloring and corn syrup came together for a pretty serious zombie. Work loved it, but a few coworkers freaked out. Definitely an ugly costume, and not the traditional sexy one.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-mRxBHp7sSlM/VFPI0AcgesI/AAAAAAAAM0o/vbIcGWlQVEI/s716-no/IMG_4167-MIX.jpg" alt="K panel"></p>

<p>It worked great with J. His hazmat suit (a legit Amazon purchase) and my seriously ill zombie were couples costumes without being like, Peanut Butter and Jelly.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/wTNjCJT-fdipjaZbB_r8xjW3yY5PzMfou4rC0Qd8VGY=w598-h716-no" alt="j costume"></p>

<p>But my whole weekend wasn’t spent sitting in sticky corn syrup blood and heavy makeup.</p>

<p>I had a nail appointment with the best salon in San Francisco. Legit, I’ve tried at least 4 different salons with gels. Every single one I had cracking by the third day. And they do gel nail art. Shakira at <a href="http://sparklesanfrancisco.com/">Sparkle</a> is my fave. I seriously shell out for her every single month. That’s how long her nails last. An entire month. (If you don’t mind some grow out!)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-JoJlJYYi3fA/VFbUZ_kn3hI/AAAAAAAAM6w/jK3tqKK3tus/s716-no/IMG_4202.JPG" alt="nails"></p>

<p>The only thing as good looking as my nails, was chilling with <a href="http://almostgettingittogether.com/">Cassie</a>. We got the most beautiful beet salads ever at <a href="http://www.bluebarngourmet.com/">Blue Barn</a>. Seriously. I want to eat this every day of my life now. Forever and always.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/gJN3vD6H38xqIcN9VEz16Q3PJ7RLm131hjrrzOLcU7g=w955-h716-no" alt="salad"></p>

<p>Not to make it look like my entire Sunday was food, but between coffee and lunch we stopped at the Fort Mason Farmer’s Market. Super adorable. I bought some candied walnuts and walnut butter from a stand by <a href="http://olddogranch.com/">Old Dog Ranch</a>. The candied walnuts were just okay, but the maple walnut butter was out of this world. I got a mini jar, and thank god, because I’m literally like half way through it one day later.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/mXL7lgkbuGFTvco6wdyb8bOkVKoig4iGLEJB9goD4b8=w955-h716-no" alt="farmers market"></p>

<p>It was the coolest weekend, and I’m only sad I didn’t take more pictures! Now it’s back to work, and writing interview feedback while watching How to Get Away with Murder.</p>

<p>That said, while the start of the week sometimes sucks on the work horizon, I love using it to structure the other five days. I’m hoping to get a bunch of yoga and running in this week. Hold me to it. </p>

<p>What’re your goals for the week? </p>

	<p>Being off routine is hard. And I’ve been out of whack this week.</p>

<p>I flew Monday night into Baltimore. Drove to Maryland. Slept for 4 hours, and then woke up to interview a bunch of awesome students. The campus was gorgeous</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/uJv3RlnS1it3oYHYZRGTuHXcscFOxEIGOYvROXTec00=w707-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>I finally felt like I was experiencing fall.</p>

<p>Then I flew back Wednesday and had a lot of work waiting for me. I’ve basically been holed up at my desk and home until today when I helped with the company Halloween party.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/QUkuFwp9oNoOEC8oRpm1-2Cq3_dG5zhct5toSqgO1Jo=w1038-h607-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Now I’m putting together a last minute zombie costume. (Oh god)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ypQXQHDhJQYLsLtzWVWDVwrOjl0KtjKilkOpygokiQ0=w501-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Mixing up some fake blood as we speak. </p>

<p>What are your weekend plans? Halloween parties anyone?</p>

	</div>
	<p>Spoiler alert. I ran Run 10 Feed 10, and I was bad. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s start from the beginning though. I woke up at 6 am to get ready for this race. I had carefully prepared all the things I needed the night before. However, my morning brain couldn&#39;t remember where I put them. So I spent like half an hour freaking out and looking for them. Good going Kay.</p>

<p>I pulled myself together, and hauled myself to Crissy Field. I was pumped. The views were beautiful. There were a ton of runners. It was good. I started snapping some quick pictures from the field of the bridge.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-JLSTgjLKqvw/VE01Eoh6K5I/AAAAAAAAMdA/4GcCJDtqWNM/w955-h716-no/IMG_4068.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>I hate subtle foreshadowing, so I&#39;m going to be obvious here. The bridge looks pretty high up from where I was taking photos. I thought nothing of that at the time. The morning was beautiful, there were cute booths. I got to put on a temporary tattoo and got prizes for taking selfies (basically my dream). The world was good.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/oPjIXWqMXULk-fHw8WGbMWHrYd6C5QZ2BOtZRre4r88=s716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Women&#39;s Health put on a killer display. There were a bunch of adorable sponsor booths. We warmed up with a very calm instructor from a local yoga studio. They had tons of photographers coming around snapping pictures, making me feel like people should always be taking pictures of my pre-run festivities. </p>

<p>They lined up the runners into different pace groups. I wanted this to be a chill run, and didn&#39;t want to feel super competitive (I did this run to take pictures of the bridge!) So I put myself in the last group.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/xb6nh2Ig8Cy7LDBk8DucHLSOfwyxFFLHAYJgAwQ2AcI=w955-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>And we started! There wasn&#39;t a lot of fanfare for this. I hit the button on my cheapo Garmin, and started my playlist that I haven&#39;t updated since Seawheeze and started running. </p>

<p>The photos of the bridge, are pretty killer. And the road was blocked off, so I didn&#39;t feel overcrowded or anything.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/g6CTli4YXS60_cK1vMpZad5XyBSXcqSPX6DzwCg5Mis=w955-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-L5PVajP060w/VE01S6Jb9sI/AAAAAAAAMfA/loE2VqAxrW4/w955-h716-no/IMG_4079.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>However. This route starts with a whole lot of uphill. Annnd. Elevation and I aren&#39;t friends. Furthermore, if you know how a bridge works, it&#39;s basically sloping up and down the entire way. </p>

<p>On my recent runs, I haven&#39;t been feeling any fatigue until mile 5 or so. On this run, 2 miles in and I was gross. Sweaty, and breathing heavy, and a real mess. While they had water at the other end of the bridge, there were not enough water stations in the world to fix and hydrate me.</p>

<p>I finished the race at an embarrassing 10:30 pace. And looked something like this at the end:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-JsWryTDmHFc/VE01ZY_WriI/AAAAAAAAMf8/Ycs-CFV6urs/w537-h716-no/IMG_4090.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>I could give you the 150 excuses I have for a bad run. But it really boils down to lack of practice. </p>

<p>That said. Run 10 Feed 10 was beautiful, and amazing. And if you get the chance to run over the Golden Gate Bridge, you should DEFINITELY do it. At the end there was a delicious bagel and fruit spread, dynamic stretching (I waited 30 minutes in line for this and it was worth every second), and a great yoga session.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-QHi6BTmArYk/VE01FndeOtI/AAAAAAAAMdI/1wjQ94KrAMY/w955-h716-no/IMG_4069.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Please, tell me of your successes this weekend. I went to the Bridge School Benefit after this, and got to feel really good about my fitbit step count all day. So all in all, not bad. :)</p>

	<p>Today was one of those days that started with the water heater not working. Unfortunately, when you’re trying to wash your hair as infrequently as possible (for its own health!) and you’re on day four or five. You have to shower. Needless to say, my day didn’t begin on a great note.</p>

<p>It was packet pickup for Run 10 Feed 10, which is a 10k by Women’s Health that crosses the Golden Gate Bridge. I’ve only ever crossed via car, and I love trashy health magazines. So J and I walked to the running store to pick up my packet.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/5_WXeAHPHW6KLkHkd8fT4pquxQxePo8tJr32dEPlCtE=w1038-h684-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Despite the fact that it’s November, we scrambled out in tshirts because the weather here is still in the 70s. It’s crazy. Halloween is in a week.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-aWwc5m7Lyg0/VEwgXHVRWcI/AAAAAAAAMag/I7F_2koYoyI/w931-h716-no/IMG_4055.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>The Run 10 Feed 10 bag was adorable. But hilariously, I’m most excited for the temporary tattoos. I missed doing the “Run Yoga Party” spray on tattoos for Seawheeze and so I’m making up for it.</p>

<p>We ended up with another free bag for Google Shopping Express (a same day delivery service in the Bay). Their logo is a parachute, and so they sent out these adorable themed bags.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-KKPCJfw6hqQ/VEwgMsKkbII/AAAAAAAAMXo/WZ4m3CEu6QI/w537-h716-no/IMG_4049.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Reusable bags are a pretty big deal here, since it costs 10 cents to buy disposable bags at any store.</p>

<p>When we got home we had already walked a bunch around the city. So I snapchatted my family really attractive faces while J worked. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-FNcJqtnk2Lw/VEwgbE_drXI/AAAAAAAAMZU/0jfKn9dQfO4/w537-h716-no/IMG_4058.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>I’ve got dinner plans and an early bedtime waiting for me tonight. (Race starts at 7:30ish) Eugggh. </p>

<p>What’s the best swag you ever got? (I hope it’s not temporary tattoos, otherwise, we gotta talk.)</p>
