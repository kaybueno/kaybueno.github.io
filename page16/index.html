	</div>

	<p>I almost cried over two out of three of those today.</p>

<p>I’ll fill you in. I have a huge crush on Jonathan Adler. I don’t even know what he looks like, or if he’s a good person. But I love his designs. So when he came out with a cheaper department store line, I bought a ton up. </p>

<p>Unfortunately I had to ship it to my new apartment, and in the process, one of my favorite pieces, an elephant lamp shattered. :( I’ve been super glue-ing him back together, but I’ve had to glue so much, I ran out. Here he is in a mostly fixed state. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-DkiXGQnn_L0/U-uOF9toaII/AAAAAAAAHCc/JmSyqfB2evk/w837-h716-no/IMG_2724.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Then today, on the way to work, I got a flat tire on my bike. Which seemed okay, because I had a tube and pump at work. So I worked at replacing the tube (I’m a total bike fixing novice, this took me basically forever), after many attempts to pump my bike, I found out the needle was broken, so the new tube won’t even inflate. </p>

<p>Here was a glory photo from when I thought I fixed it. Haha. WRONG.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/6ghX3zG0Q0a58C0eR-EJHKXSITQEi6rSTgHfdROCIDA=w567-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Otherwise, my day was amazing. I took a beautiful walk at lunch and came across the most bizarre 80’s style fitness track. You can walk around and stop at all these little stations in the woods to work on different skills. I skipped the fitness stations, but eventually I want to come out and play with the rings station. One of my dream goals for life is to be able to do a pull up, and it could be fun to do some aerial skills on this thing:</p>

<p>Soylent today has been good. It’s hard doing an experiment on yourself. Like I’ve felt a little eugh when it comes to digestive issues. Fortunately, I have yet to become a noxious gas machine like some drinkers report. (Knock on wood). But I definitely felt a little on edge today. However, two of my coworkers went home sick. So is it a stomach bug? Soylent? Guess I’ll find out in a few days.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-63QYJDPwtOc/U-uQM0rbulI/AAAAAAAAHGY/n8WIgvAJfuE/w548-h716-no/IMG_2727.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>My batch today tasted the best yet though. Getting good measurements on a food scale has helped a lot with that. (Since I don’t want to drink a whole 2000 calorie bag). And actually, this is probably disgusting, but I don’t mind it luke warm. I chill it overnight for whatever reason, but I actually kind of enjoy it after it’s gotten back to room temperature. </p>

<p>Whatever, I’m crazy. Hope everyone else’s day went better than my own. :)</p>

	<h1><a href="/8-12-2014/soylent-day-two.html">Soylent Day Two, as told in selfies.</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		August 12, 2014
	</div>

	<p>I&#39;ve been making my daily batch of Soylent the night before. I’ve heard letting sit, makes the liquid less gritty, and also, it gives me more time in the morning to get ready. I’m lazy, so I just measure, blend, and then shove the entire blender in the fridge for the night. (minus the base, guys, I’m not an idiot.)</p>

<p>Doing this means I can wake up, re-blend for a second to reintegrate the oils that have separated (delicious) and go.</p>

<p>Sorry in advance for all the selfies. After yesterdays photos, I needed a lot of make up and good angles in today&#39;s post. :)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/CBPIJcl_0fF156E36fX72nMsovGURT9_nj8CHpo-Wb4=w715-h716-no" alt="Kay plus blender"></p>

<p>Day two was as easy, or easier than day one. I actually have a hard time finishing all the soylent by the end of the day. I need to drink more in the morning, because before Soylent, I most naturally ate the most during the day.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/X7WEWJiQj3U3FK0prUDv7JoAQ5CWblBWoAbV4EnI2bs=w903-h716-no" alt="soylent in blender bottle"> </p>

<p>So far, no one in person has noticed or asked me about my kind of bizarre eating habits, which is really relieving, because honestly, I don&#39;t really want to explain. My suggestion for keeping it under wraps? I&#39;ve been able to fit it all in a blender bottle, which you can see in basically every picture. So it&#39;s pretty small and inconspicuous. </p>

<p>But, I&#39;m still worried, I can&#39;t avoid lunch with the coworkers forever. Lately, I&#39;ve been hoping to do non-eating activities during my normal lunch break. I figure walking, and yoga can replace my usual munching. Unfortunately, the last two lunches, I’ve just been doing work at my desk. Uggggh.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-u2nb_4jLKjk/U-pS_OfZHMI/AAAAAAAAHAk/4ZrTT4QX3gg/s716-no/IMG_2705-MIX.jpg" alt="Quad selfies"> </p>

<p>Overall though, I feel even, and happy not making choices. The last two days have been fairly stressful, and usually that would mean I’d be chomping my way through snacks and coffee at work. But I haven’t. I mean, I still drink coffee, tea, and other nearly 0 calorie beverages. But I’m not trying to binge my stress away.</p>

<p>It&#39;s silly but, I want magical results at day two, so then I’d feel like I have something great to tell you, or to write about. So far, I haven’t exercised heavily since drinking soylent, but I’m hoping to do a good run tomorrow and see how it goes!</p>

	<h1><a href="/8-11-2014/soylent-day-1.html">Soylent Day One!</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		August 11, 2014
	</div>

	<p>Before I tried Soylent, I read about it everywhere. As much as I could. But reading about it was unfulfilling because all of the descriptions are so bland… so neutral…</p>

<p>But I get it now! When I got home, it was almost easier to describe what Soylent wasn’t, than what it was. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-6mLCc2lqXWo/U-mSipjQmTI/AAAAAAAAG78/nEnEh1WTcLA/w955-h716-no/IMG_2689.JPG" alt="Measuring my day of food"></p>

<p>Like, you know how when you eat food, and it’s your favorite food. The way you eat is happy, the act of consuming is an exciting moment. And you&#39;re like super happy. In your eating. It’s a good food experience.</p>

<p>But like, you can also have really bad food experiences. You can eat something gross, or something you’re not in the mood for, and you honestly don’t want another bite. It’s a negative food experience.</p>

<p>Soylent is neither of these. I found myself taking sips to keep myself from getting hungry (something I quickly noticed if I got too focused in my work and forgot to drink). But I was neither repulsed or excited to eat more. It’s pretty late at night and I’m only a little more than 2/3rds of the way through 1000 calories of Soylent. But I just sip at it every 20-30 minutes or so.</p>

<p>I did eat real food today though to ease in. Two apples. One first thing in the morning, and one at 5 pm. I want to make sure my digestive tract doesn’t freak out on me. </p>

<p>Overall it went, well. No reason to be nervous. Granted, everything is easiest the first day. Everything but posting these pictures!</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-anY_c5mfPPw/U-mW0P0Z0DI/AAAAAAAAG8M/BWOnKWwdhCE/w922-h532-no/kittstart.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>I hate putting these late night “Before” pictures up, but I want to track my progress and see how soylent affects my overall body. So pardon the awkward photos we snapped at midnight last night. But hopefully, these not so sexy shots will lead to some great afters. :)</p>

<p>Total today ~1240 calories</p>

	<h1><a href="/8-10-2014/anticipating-soylent.html">Anticipating Soylent</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		August 10, 2014
	</div>

	<p>I love the feeling of anticipation right up until I have to take the first step. During the morning, I dream about running, until I hit the moment where I need to lace up my shoes and take off. When I’m just ready to go, I hit that initial dread of the activity. What if it goes wrong? What if I hate it?</p>

<p>So it’s no surprise that now, the night before I embark on a primarily liquid diet, that I feel that ache in the pit of my stomach. Unboxing soylent. Beautiful. Showing the packaging off to my boyfriend, amazing. But as I go to eat my “last supper”, I feel uneasy. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-vbQMTypmDZw/U-TvStzUjUI/AAAAAAAAGzY/DDZ_OMWWWSc/w647-h716-no/IMG_2648.JPG" alt="My starter kit"></p>

<p>I received my shipment of soylent last week. And because I’d like to pretend my life demands fanfare, I refused to begin a liquid diet on a Thursday, because as any yo-yo dieter knows, diets must begin on a Monday, to give you the entire weekend to binge and feel bad about your choices.</p>

<p>Soylent comes in a ~2000 calorie pack, and advertises ideal nutrition. As I’m a woman, and relatively sedentary, I plan on experimenting with my calorie intake until I find a good medium. Ideally somewhere between 1000-1500, depending on my activity levels.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-jmBYPGGJJ-o/U-TvekpiidI/AAAAAAAAG1E/bbXrywTLfqA/w850-h716-no/IMG_2657.JPG" alt="One ‘day’ of Soylent"></p>

<p>All this said, I’m still a social person, and I plan on eating normal food over the weekends so my boyfriend isn’t driven insane by my food experimenting, and hopefully so I can’t ruin my digestive system (and other body systems?) too much.</p>

<p>At least I have until tomorrow.</p>
