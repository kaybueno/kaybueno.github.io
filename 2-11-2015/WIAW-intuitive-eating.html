	<p>It’s one of those weeks where <a href="//www.peasandcrayons.com">Wednesday</a> feels like Friday. Probably because I’m hopping a plane to Vegas tomorrow. Intuitive eating was the perfect eating experience to try to embody on a day where I felt like I had to micromanage every other aspect of my life.</p>

<p>While actual intuitive eating has a lot of components, and is much more than a day’s effort, I wanted to see how I would do if I just let myself eat when I decided I needed to. Each thing I ate will talk about how I felt about eating it.</p>

<p>Breakfast started a little different. I had two cranberry vegan pancakes, and decidedly non-vegan eggs. I walked to work this morning, and as someone who experiences morning hunger without even moving, I was pretty hungry when I got in.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/zEN_PEetcHlawpimCKGbyl25zvvnwTHIdq7KdfIKJzca=w955-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>How I felt: I had just walked two miles to work, I probably should have waited 15 minutes for my stomach to settle a bit more before eating to better gauge my hunger.</p>

<p>Lunch I didn’t have a lot of choice in, my coworkers and I eat together every day around noon. So even though I started feeling a little hungry at 11:30, this was the one meal I couldn’t go intuitive on.</p>

<p>We stopped at a bbq food truck, where I grabbed flank steak, whole wheat pasta with tomato and spinach, and a whole bunch of roasted broccoli.</p>

<p>How I felt: I was definitely ready to eat by the time this came around, and I felt pretty nourished by this plate. </p>

<p>I had ⅓ of an apple fritter. A coworker came around with treats for his birthday, and two of my teammates and I split one. There’s no picture because I stood in a huge group, drinking coffee and celebrating a friend’s achievements. Sometimes, you can’t always snap what you ate.</p>

<p>How I felt: This was celebration food. I definitely wasn’t hungry at this point, but I didn’t indulge in an entire dessert myself, and it was the right move.</p>

<p>I grabbed another snack later in the day. Work has been stocking these bars, and they’re pretty much like healthy candy. </p>

<p>How I felt: Honestly. I think I just grabbed one of these to have an excuse to get up from my desk. I love these, but I wasn’t hungry when I ate it.</p>

<p>I went for a run, biked home, and then J and I spent the evening cleaning. At the end of the night after a bunch of sweat, bleach, and exhaustion, I just wasn’t hungry. I grabbed a handful of See’s Hot Hearts. (These are like the best Hot Tamales I’ve ever had, and cinnamon candy is difficult for me to go overboard on.)</p>

<p>How I felt: I probably didn’t need these, I was mostly tired, not very hungry.</p>

<p>I think I’m better at identifying food I am hungry for, and food I’m craving than I give myself credit for. I definitely ate a bunch of sugary things today, more than I usually shoot for, but overall it wasn’t terrible.</p>

<p>I’d love to eventually transition over to a more intuitive style of eating, but right now, I do live, and like living with some food rules. So we’ll see.</p>

<p>Do you eat intuitively? What’s the best thing you ate recently?</p>
