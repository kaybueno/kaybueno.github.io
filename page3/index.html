	<p>On the Big Island, we stayed in the cutest B&amp;B right outside Volcanoes National Park. Bamboo Orchid Cottage is basically a giant house buried in the middle of (what feels like) the rainforest. The owner is fantastically fun, and takes great care of the place, when we came in after hiking, the fireplace was lit, a soothing CD was on, and the room smelled amazing. </p>

<p>But my favorite part was the breakfast:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/tNAA6yV3qOsxM6g69jd01eCI6kOJrwSlnqU3OxhtkZA=w845-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>The owner made us all lobster shaped papaya boats! The fruit on Hawaii was so fresh that I could have eaten two of these every morning. So delicious. My other favorite (and one of the only things I bought in Hawaii) was this adorable running shirt.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/D5jpeMh3ztJPMks3VI0dszMP2Eng2_wQ101seD9I8lM=w537-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>The store was so cute, and when we walked by I had to run in and have it. Had to. I can’t wait to do a race in this sucker.</p>

<p>We spent some time hiking Akaka Falls, hiking is a strong word as it’s just a tiny loop. But unlike in Maui, the falls here had water! It was a beautiful destination, but be warned, they make you pay to enter, even if you don’t park in their lot.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-9-OrUfrB19o/VB9JRklLUkI/AAAAAAAAJkU/6BGtZ7pmXRw/w537-h716-no/IMG_3665.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>J and I hit up some other scenic points. They were nice, but I was tired, and not feeling so well. Fortunately, J took picture duty.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Thf3Fx1KeTs/VB9KAKcFcPI/AAAAAAAAJpI/VrBkFNSz3gw/w955-h716-no/IMG_3691.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>We flew back to Maui, since we were departing from there, and checked into our hotel. I was only feeling worse, so we ordered room service. It was my first room service ever. I took a picture, even if I didn’t really eat any of it. :/</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-L0gQwEkZRFk/VB9KHcqc6RI/AAAAAAAAL4A/nfZ3Xn7Tf5c/w955-h716-no/IMG_3696.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Still feeling ill the next morning, I sent J out to our snorkel reservation. I was bummed I missed it, but his pictures are too amazing not to post.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-C5ZA5-W-bGg/VB-pn-hEewI/AAAAAAAALbU/-Kc0N2h_T-A/w1038-h688-no/turtle-head.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>We flew home that evening. It was an amazing trip, and we really got to enjoy good weather, and no internet connection (a lovely break from the all the time internet connection we have). J and I definitely hope to go back seeing as we’re closer to Hawaii than NYC now. :)</p>

	</div>
	<p>After a few days in Maui, we decided to hop on over to the Big Island. While there were lava reports on the radio, we didn’t see any active lava. We didn’t think it would be in good spirits to tour on someone else’s devastation. So instead we spent a lot of time at Volcanoes National Park exploring previous eruption sites.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-FI4O0ZC6V_0/VB9vWUX-wHI/AAAAAAAAJyo/IRAWmfKDdoY/w1038-h692-no/IMG_1168.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>We woke up early the morning after our flight to head over to the park. We wanted to start the day by stretching our legs, so, we hiked the Kīlauea Iki Trail to the Thurston lava tube. It’s a 6 mile hike into what was once a lake of lava. Having since dried out, the crater is a great place to explore volcanic scenery. Getting there early led to much more amazing pictures. By 10 am, tons of tourist buses had offloaded, filling the crater.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/8qeoFChDldhfzPzB3fzGqYFORHe0C4at18xwqGRa77U=w524-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>We learned a lot about what happens after a volcanic eruption, and getting to see the rocks and crags up close was great.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-WYWjWGiFGro/VB9vgECbLEI/AAAAAAAAJzI/rXAawJudE-M/w477-h716-no/IMG_1195.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>J was really into the learning aspect of the crater, and I was really into the making fun of J for learning so much about a crater aspect.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_sLeHtxIGEim-Vqw5G2xjIk1T1Zn36EIWOOrocTl40Q=w581-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Though it’s a kind of random picture, a few days before, I had caught a surfboard with my arm while surfing, and had developed a pretty serious bruise. I wanted to preserve it with a photo. Better my arm than my face, I guess. :)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/P6oRx7G0ZmDhOs2utVWKvX-H9khU3RxxzumJRHE1wN4=w979-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>We scaled out of the crater and into the lava tube, where bus, upon tour bus was parked. The tube is a great in and out jaunt, but it didn’t really offer much when compared to the crater. And the pictures inside made my inner photographer cry. With all the flash, poor lighting, and people everywhere, it didn’t lead to great pictures, or a great experience.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Zc_vJJbFJ7E/VB8vV6SO6tI/AAAAAAAAJOA/ro2vLORrjSE/w955-h716-no/IMG_3524.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>After, we drove the chain of craters road. The views were awesome, but the road was more hyped that we’d have liked. It’s a 20-30 mile road that stops where a lava flow crossed the road in 2003, blocking the path.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Gm7oRBZz8Z0/VB9vml2pFNI/AAAAAAAAJ0E/wfQUPLYJOEE/w1038-h692-no/IMG_1219.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>At the end of the day, we saw our first real lava sighting. We drove to the Jaggar Musuem to watch the lava out of the Halema&#39;uma&#39;u Crater. It was a really beautiful experience. We got in right before sundown, and stayed until sunset. </p>

	<p>Ughhh. I’ve been sick this entire weekend, and looking at pictures of me hiking and healthy in Hawaii was just too much to handle. But I wanted to get the rest of the trip up on the blog before I lose any more momentum and just start blogging cute exercise clothes I want to buy or something.</p>

<p>J and I were last in Hana. Having completed the infamous Road to Hana trip. It was our first (and only) night on the east side of the island. So we wanted to catch sunrise.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-FSauXjXzYew/VB-ojuZn_SI/AAAAAAAALVg/PBok97Nk0HM/w1062-h708-no/IMG_0770.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Needless to say, it was worth it.</p>

<p>Getting up for sunrise made it easy for us to grab an early start. After the sun came up, we headed out to the Oheo Gulch, aka the Seven Sacred Pools. It’s technically an extension of Haleakala National Park, although it only has two trails. The trail down to the pools, and the Pipiwai trail. We did both.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-0Dr3qSBlCjY/VB-o5uw9KHI/AAAAAAAALXU/mlyxhqwko60/w1062-h708-no/IMG_0950.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>The trek down to the pools is short, sweet, and passes by that giant tree you see above. Unfortunately, during our trip, the pools were pretty dry, with only one, maybe two to swim in. If you don’t bring your suit (we didn’t) there’s not a whole lot to see at the pools. It’s a great place to float, relax, and grab a nice tan, but not much else. You can see the swimmers behind Jon’s head in this snap at the pools.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-CDezCLEVcLY/VB-o-DtnmxI/AAAAAAAALXo/gfPzABdMwI8/w1062-h708-no/IMG_0998.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>So we headed to the Pipiwai trail. This is one of those hikes that really makes you wait for the good parts. It was 80 or 90 degrees, humid, and most of the waterfalls along the way were pretty dry. Out of need for shade (and a break from walking on an exposed trail uphill) we stopped to climb a tree.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-mLGFEyfU9lM/VB-pFHBlbSI/AAAAAAAALYQ/ReaYECKIg74/w477-h716-no/IMG_1020.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>After a mile and a half in or so (doesn’t sound like much until your ass is sweating, hiking up hill, with no shade). You reach the bamboo forest. When I read about this before going, I was kind of underwhelmed. Like “Woo hoo, what’s so cool about a bunch of bamboo?”</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AN6al0HCxBU/VB-pJqZY2CI/AAAAAAAALYk/GYgBh4tlqIQ/w477-h716-no/IMG_1025.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>I’ll tell you what! Bamboo sounds like deep, hollow, wind chimes whenever a breeze rolls through. Add that to the fact that our path was shaded, and J and I thought it was the greatest thing ever. </p>

<p>It felt pretty surreal to walk through the bamboo though, it’s just not a plant or experience we ever get at home.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-N5e9UihtbT0/VB-pJ0C3HvI/AAAAAAAALYo/wX2JecS77pc/w1062-h708-no/IMG_1029.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>After what seems like a lot of bamboo. You hit the end! Which is this beautiful waterfall. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-zWSDob6NLq4/VB-pLv1NOJI/AAAAAAAALYw/_bil7P3IRLo/w1062-h708-no/IMG_1035.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>The sign we’re standing in front of said to not cross it, or fear getting swept away and dying. However, the current ahead was nothing more than a trickle, so we (and basically the other 20 people who hiked there) went past the sign. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7IK926oKYFM/VB-pRNkY7vI/AAAAAAAALZM/mqR1kXn5D6c/w477-h716-no/IMG_1050.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>That’s the entire falls (with J at the bottom for scale). It was huge, and beautiful. But very very slim. A lot of the falls were almost dry when we visited. And like the pools at it’s base, there were groups of people who came to the falls to swim. So, word to the wise, in Maui, basically, always wear a suit. Or, always be swimming… Or something</p>

<p>We hiked back to the car. Left Hana, and got lunch. We stopped at the Naihiku market and J got the most amazing fried ahi tuna ever.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-pg45aJCrsgg/VB8mfREAfeI/AAAAAAAALgU/TfEffExsFVA/w884-h716-no/IMG_3325.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>It doesn’t look like much, but the fish was fresh caught, and fried in front of us, and was probably, no joke, the best food we had on Maui. The passion fruit, aka lilikoi, aka get in my stomach best fruit ever, was good too.</p>

<p>We finished our drive, took some pictures of the scenery (which is beautiful, even if J doesn’t look enthused in the photo below) and went back for a relaxing evening in Wailea.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-_HnKkUignm4/VB-pN4YWaOI/AAAAAAAALY4/K_S5ZM3u3fQ/w1062-h708-no/IMG_1058.jpg" alt=""></p>

	<h2><a href="/9-24-2014/road-to-hana-1.html">Hawaii Day 3 - Road to Hana!</a></h2>
	<div class="metadata">

	</div>
	<p>Road to Hana! Road to Hana! Road to Hana! </p>

<p>Not to say it’s name too many times, but Road to Hana is one of my favorite parts about Maui. It’s a great reason to get a jeep, take the top off, and drive a few hours down a long windy road that goes to nowhere. (And buy, and consume a lot of banana bread along the way!)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-s5Kco6FBw5E/VB-oufZyDPI/AAAAAAAALWo/1sIPJvAu2SA/w1062-h708-no/IMG_0856.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>So of course, J and I rented a Jeep (after a lot of begging on my part for a Jeep) and set out early on day 3 to embark on the Road to Hana. It’s a drive that could be done back and forth in one day, but J and I wanted to hike a bunch along the way, and do the Pipiwai trail at the Oheo Gulch. So we decided to spend a night in Hana. </p>

<p>This was almost disastrous, as we planned this trip to Hawaii just the week before we flew here. And little did we know, the original day we planned to do Road to Hana, there was a huge foot race/relay on the route. (We’re talking thousands of people running on a one lane road) Thankfully, when we tried to book a hotel, the receptionist told us we were choosing the worst dates for this. Phew.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/NDWzD7LDKbOi2GbZdMLKyZHHkiFU53FG0DhuS5v_ZmQ=w489-h715-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Road to Hana is a journey, filled with twisty passes and one laned bridges, and J and I didn’t want to go it alone. So we downloaded the Road to Hana GyPSy app on our phones. Though the narrator is a little cheesy, without him, we would have never stumbled across things like rainbow eucalyptus!</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-_ILasbMsR7E/VB-omN9PjoI/AAAAAAAALV4/wa5ecKZL-3c/w477-h716-no/IMG_0804.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-f6Goa6m-3J0/VB-olMsqzqI/AAAAAAAALV0/uOIYvt1i88A/w477-h716-no/IMG_0796.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Which are, in my mind, the prettiest trees I’ve ever seen. (Take that cherry blossoms). We also ended up in Keanae. A quiet town with pretty black rock beaches. One of the great things about this narrated, GPS based tour, is that the narrator gives you five important things to do on the road. So there’s no analysis paralysis of trying to pick the best places to stop along the way.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-EPNa5-3laKc/VB91UcXnVnI/AAAAAAAAKXw/cWRt7PIRZow/w1062-h708-no/IMG_0823.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>At the end of the road, we stopped in Hana. We found a super cute hotel called the Hana Kai Maui (of no relation to the Mana Kai Maui). It was seriously one of the most, clean, modern places we stayed. It felt beachy without having that fake resort feel. And the kitchen was high tech. I wanted to live there forever.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-EDQooL44HU0/VB92YQvF9dI/AAAAAAAAKeA/mzgYupFIDrU/w1062-h708-no/IMG_0873.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Since we were on the east side of the island, I hopped into bed as early as possible so I could wake up and catch the sunrise the next day at 5:30 am. </p>

<p>What’s the last adventure you took?</p>
