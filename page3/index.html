	<p>Woah, it&#39;s already Monday. This weekend went by so fast. Here&#39;s the Spark Notes version of my life the last three days. :)</p>

<p>Friday night we fit in two shows that my boyfriend wanted to go to, they both started at 8. Fortunately, one band was the opener, and the other was the headliner.</p>

<p>So, we started with the opener, <a href="http://www.thecongressmusic.org/">The Congress</a>, one of my boyfriend’s favorite folk rock bands. </p>

<p>And then we jetted off to see <a href="http://www.hoodieallen.com/">Hoodie Allen</a>, an old, like high school old, friend of my boyfriend’s. If you haven’t heard Hoodie, I would affectionately describe his music, as white boy rap-pop.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/FiCwMkmAXxh14qJBTOKKiHQGTVkMYcbMGQq7UHQuZpQ=w637-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>The Congress was laid back, slightly buzzed 30 and 40 somethings, so we were at least 10 years younger than most of the crowd. But Hoodie Allen was mostly high school girls, the show was a lot of jumping, cake throwing, and confetti flying.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-fBdkedVh6tQ/VGmf8AZWvKI/AAAAAAAAOyQ/fXvglScu9go/w1038-h654-no/jfetti.png" alt=""></p>

<p>It was almost surreal how different the two were.</p>

<p>Saturday, J and I spent the day urban hiking. I really wanted one of the most delicious and guilty burgers that evening, and so we wanted to work off the burger in advance. We did a hilly 10 mile loop in the city.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/B7d8DuZ0Z_wo8I0doijKlIGc1whPFZ815SUOXNn3An0=w608-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>We focused mainly on Mt. Sutro open space reserve, which gave us some pretty cool views of Sutro Towers.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-wRTkYzEW9KI/VGmohKnTO2I/AAAAAAAAO0o/cWSUDJLmEHU/s716-no/sutrollage.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Sadly. Despite our serious hike. We couldn’t get reservations for burgers. So the whole hike was for nothing. Jk. We had a lot of fun.</p>

<p>Finally, Sunday I hung out with <a href="www.almostgettingittogether.com">Cassie</a> and <a href="www.instagram.com/ginamarie_hlc">Gina</a></p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-uY_VgnshJKI/VGmVwhaKeEI/AAAAAAAAOxI/TBz2YOXa-uU/w1038-h702-no/2014-11-16.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>We also rocked an urban hike in the Presidio. It went by super fast thanks to a lot of venting, wine, and really amazing grapes from the farmers’ market.
It kept me close to the ocean, so I was pretty happy</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/tNU7SDKcZBBmR2_wQoWvhIXIi68Hy_dag9xbq8fE5BQ=w569-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>J and I made up for a burgerless Saturday by indulging Sunday night instead. I would have a picture of my favorite burger in San Francisco. Unfortunately I literally could not wait to eat it. So I didn’t even sneak a picture. You’ll have to imagine it.</p>

<p>How was your weekend? Ever been to a crazy show?</p>

	<p>Random things I’m thinking about lately.</p>

<h2>1. Challenges</h2>

<p>The year is ending, and I feel like it’s one of those seasons where I start thinking: “I should improve myself!”. I’m not sure if I want to take on a sleep goal, or shoot for weight loss, or train for something, or get more flexible or… And the problem is, I kind of want to do them all. I think it’s a mix of boredom and anticipating New Years and Holidays.  </p>

<p>Obviously evidenced by the picture below, I could use some biceps -- guns. :)  </p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/sn_nBR0goVOg0bxhTzcZSdsve_BmdAB4QoG2y0_LagM=w599-h716-no" alt="Kay “no-guns” Bueno"></p>

<h2>2.  Blogging induced baking urges.</h2>

<p>I made some mediocre pancakes last night. Pumpkin protein pancakes to be specific. (Yeah, I know, we’re over pumpkin. We just saw our 8th pumpkin muffin this week. But guys, I want to be on the bandwagon too) I mean, to be real with you, I haven’t been cooking much until this whole blog thing. But now that I see it everywhere. I have the urge to put things on my stove, and in my microwave, </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/6lgZSvc31SlwHc649e4-AerNhItKJDhf4Jze_n_2BiA=s716-no" alt=""></p>

<h2>3.  Christmas gifts</h2>

<p>So I have two siblings, an “adopted” sibling, my parents, my grandparents, my best friend, a handful of other friends, and my siblings’ and parent’s significant others. It’s unromantic and definitely not whimsical, but I’m going to need to make a spreadsheet soon of what I’m getting everyone. Christmas is in 40 days (or so) and that’s mind blowing.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/hsuwM_SUhJitksA4yRESqYGd8PWK5xZqzwu9yVFKEb4=w537-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Christmas last year, we all get themed pajamas every year!</p>

<h2>4.  What should I be drinking</h2>

<p>I saw a lot of people drinking the celestial seasons holiday teas. And I thought, I want some of that. So I bought it. J is making fun of me because he only drinks tea that’s leaves. Secret. I probably drink a little too much diet soda, but, I gave it up for a year, and didn’t notice a difference, so I’m back on it. I figure sugar cookie tea can’t be that much worse for you than diet rootbeer.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s J and I drinking tea in the summer. It was pretty good despite the long face.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-eEuKlkrzgIY/U-mST_5CtCI/AAAAAAAAG4E/MhWQ70rz6Oc/w537-h716-no/IMG_2672.JPG" alt="J and I with teas"></p>

<p>I snuck a cup this morning. Unsurprisingly it was pretty good. Even J admitted it wasn’t that overpowering.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-GMawJhQ3Dxw/VGZBcK_DE_I/AAAAAAAAOIs/xHZqeRrfl4o/w537-h716-no/IMG_4518.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>What&#39;s on your mind lately? Are you the type of person who makes resolutions? What do you drink at night? Help a woman out. :)</p>

	<p>I was a kid who should have been born on the water. Every time I’ve been to the ocean, for surfing, stand-up paddle boarding, or just swimming, I’ve had a blast. Maybe even the best time of my life. Unfortunately, thanks to a midwest upbringing, skin that burns at the slightest hint of sun, and the serious cost of ocean activities, I’ve never been able to actually improve my surf skills after the initial lesson.</p>

<p>Enter Surf Set.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Hlg3axFxiPtkNIElZuHBnwmIwLrx2x6tXBrQN4Eb1jA=w1038-h657-no" alt=""></p>

<p>For those of you who haven’t heard of it before, Surf Set is pretty much like surfing on land. (A lovely experience for those of us who want to avoid burns, uncomfortable wet suits, and sharks). A surf board balanced on three, bosu-like balls, mimics the instability of the ocean. The class lets you practice both moves necessary to improve surfing, but also other non-traditional strength, cardio, and flexibility building moves.</p>

<p><a href="http://almostgettingittogether.com/surfset-review/">Cassie</a> and I went to a morning Surf Set class, at a super cute studio called <a href="http://sweatrepublicsf.com/">Sweat Republic</a>, and fell in love.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-mfYYDvf6rLY/VGAsnKEbw2I/AAAAAAAAN0E/eos1EQB8u-w/w955-h716-no/IMG_0482.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Excuse the extreme cheesing and the incorrect hand positioning. I need some more classes under my belt before I look good doing this. :)</p>

<p>The instructor was extremely friendly, and took a lot of time coming around to help correct poses, challenge students, and even help me jump from the ground onto a surfboard. It turns out she was actually a surfer, which reinforced the fact that this may actually help if I ever get on the water again.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-SlD3yMuCT2U/VGAsjSAjK8I/AAAAAAAANzI/LzGpNT_CYRM/w955-h716-no/IMG_0474.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>The class began with a quick warm up, which was primarily comprised of on the ground stretching.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-PTvGEiI4jvo/VGAsinyw29I/AAAAAAAAN0w/raeZdMXIxW0/w955-h716-no/IMG_0473.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>We worked our way through cardio, strength training, balancing, and a mock surf session in the hour long class. While I definitely sweat some, I felt it most the next day in my obliques. Balancing and stability are good for the abs. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-O9CprsRrpvU/VGAshU5weGI/AAAAAAAAN0c/EJRvwyrHyP0/w955-h716-no/IMG_0471.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>I had such an amazing time. Sometimes, when I read about classes in San Francisco, and they say “All Levels”, I interpret that as “All levels of people who are already physically fit”. </p>

<p>As someone who has a little bit of performance anxiety This class was actually “All Levels”, there are a bunch of different ways to customize both the difficulty of the boards, and the moves involved to make it work for you. The class went by super fast, and I can&#39;t wait to go again this weekend.</p>

<p>Would you surf on land? What crazy fitness class do I need to find next in San Francisco?</p>

	<p>I am going to blow your mind this week. (Maybe, probably not). If you know me, you know I don’t cook. I mean, up until yesterday I didn’t even have a can opener in my kitchen. (I bought one after I realized the only way I could open my can of coconut milk was to bludgeon it with a screw driver. Oops). This <a href="http://peasandcrayons.com/">Wednesday</a>, I actually made some of my own food. </p>

<p>Breakfast:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-YmNfCoBh6NA/VFz2ONSsOyI/AAAAAAAAN90/pYXEETIdQ9M/w873-h623-no/IMG_4345.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Vanilla coconut chia seed pudding. I am in love with chia seed anything, and so I decided, I had to learn to make this. I don’t have the perfect ratio for this yet (but I’m cloooose). I love my pudding a little less liquidy.</p>

<p>Lunch:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-bDlzNZbXZLg/VGJuxU9Eh4I/AAAAAAAAN9s/XRu-EiGp7mw/w873-h769-no/IMG_4459.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Work lunch. This was a side salad, a cup of vegan potato leek soup, and a piece of whole wheat flatbread with chicken and bacon. Totally delicious. </p>

<p>Snack:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-bme3mSC815I/VF5lf3od1UI/AAAAAAAAN-E/5KWiSo-Rsgw/s873-no/IMG_4360.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>No. I did not eat four larabars. But it’s hard to take a picture every time I want to eat something, so this is from when I bought them. I had the carrot cake. It kinda let me down. I think I’m too much of a child. Only chocolate chip cookie for me. </p>

<p>Other snack: </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-JUUbXzgPRnU/VF1pLpYDFSI/AAAAAAAAN-M/kLspILo3y-A/w873-h1164-no/IMG_4350.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Someone was giving out chocolate outside of my building. Yes please.</p>

<p>I had an apple somewhere in here, but I didn’t snap a photograph. Imagine an apple. </p>

<p>Dinner snack:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Jkyi2vHZ238/VGLUAF7AYEI/AAAAAAAAN9k/WT42_CngX3w/s873-no/IMG_4463.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>I don’t love dinner. But I do love the fact that I’m popping my own popcorn lately. I take some kernals, and coconut oil, wait for them to pop. (And also freak out when they pop. I dropped an entire spoonful of popcorn kernals on the ground when one popped in my face.) Then I smother this in nutritional yeast and a dash of salt. Delish.</p>

<p>What have you been making lately? I&#39;ve been experimenting on a peanut butter mug cake. I found the most irresistable peanut butter chips at Whole Foods this week. :)</p>
