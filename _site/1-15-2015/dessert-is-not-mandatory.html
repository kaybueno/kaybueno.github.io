	<p>You know the book “Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus”? The entire premise is that there are undeniable differences between men and women. And while I’m no relationship counselor, I actually think J and I are pretty similar, similar values, similar thought processes, similar jobs. But the one thing we don’t have in common is that J doesn’t really like sugary sweets. And I crave them all the time.</p>

<p>Once I have one sugary treat, I slowly convince myself I should have another, and maybe another, and just one more. Honestly, I envy those who assert moderation with froyo, cookies, pancakes, etc. It isn’t something I think I’ll ever be able to do. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-FjdAIQNBw2Y/VLdRgvbZv-I/AAAAAAAATkw/Djxd6uO9Giw/w537-h716-no/15%2B-%2B1" alt=""><div class="caption">This wasn’t the only cookie.</div></p>

<p>And I get into this mindset that whenever I do something difficult, or stressful, or even mildly praiseworthy, I deserve a treat. Or that because my coworkers are having dessert after a meal, I too should be able to have a cupcake, cookie or froyo after every lunch like they do.</p>

<p>My goal for January, and the subsequent months, is to only have dessert when it’s something monumental. For example. Fro-yo at work? Not really a treat. It’s available every day, if I don’t have some today, I can come back and have some tomorrow. But macarons from Paris, a cake baked by a good friend for a wedding, or even a few bites of chocolate with wine while in Napa. Totally worth it.</p>

<p>There’s a lot of temptation, the same place I brew tea, grab water, or snag an orange also has fishbowls full of M&amp;Ms, Reeses, and more. And every meal at work has dessert alongside it. But having an easy rule, makes it easier to ignore.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/YwHpMLh6wcWef9Mh2pqBPhrMosInm-U2j8zcSu7CDYbc=w1041-h680-no" alt=""><div class="caption">There&#39;s even one of these filled with Justin&#39;s Nut Butters. How can I resist?</div></p>

<p>Because dessert isn’t something I’m owed. By eating my lunch, I didn’t do anything candy, cookie, cake-worthy. And, regardless, food shouldn’t be the primary way I reward myself.</p>

<p>I know some people love moderation, and I’m a big fan of you doing whatever works for you. One day, I hope to get to a place where I can practice moderation without finishing an entire pan of brownies in one sitting. :) But until then, I need to be a little stricter with myself.</p>

<p>Do you have food “rules”? Is there anything you won’t eat?</p>
