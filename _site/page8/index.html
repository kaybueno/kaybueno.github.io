	<p>When you’re not living near your mom, but all your friends are booked for mothers day, it’s a sweet time to go away. J (the boyfriend) and I decided to head up a few hours north to Lake Tahoe to get active. We weren’t traveling in style by any means. We stayed in a sleazy, but incredibly cheap motel. Despite kind of being a baby about these things, I have to admit, it wasn’t actually that bad. It barely cost us anything. And though the room smelled of stale smoke, and our blankets were a little thin and ripped, we barely spent any time here, and the cost cutting was worth it.</p>

<p>We wanted to do a bunch with our weekend away. We expected a big hike and some kayaking. It was supposed to rain day one, but it was only a 20% chance, so we decided to risk our giant hike on the first day.</p>

<p>We hit up Emerald Bay. My favorite hike so far in Tahoe. It’s a little C-shaped bay with gorgeous mountain views, rock formations, and a formidable waterfall. My advice, don’t even plan to park near the trailhead. On our way to the trail were so over-excited when we saw the top of the waterfall and the gorgeous scenery that we spent a ton of time before even getting to the trailhead to get pictures. </p>

<p>We started the descent from the parking lot to the trailhead around 1pm, and took even more time to play around photographing the waterfall that was half a mile away. Despite a disappointing winter, there’s still enough snow melting to sport a raging falls. Armed with a new camera, and a lot of energy from morning caffeine, we spent an hour playing around with shots in the falls.</p>

<p>The day was beautiful, it was a brisk but sunny 50 degrees. We started on what we planned to be a 12 mile hike, out to the next state park (D L Bliss) and back. Emerald Bay is beautiful, you see amazing coastal views, hike a slightly variated trail, and enjoy the mountains and the bay. It’s not a hard trail by any stretch, just long and a little windy.</p>

<p>A few miles in, the sky started to drop these tiny balls of snow. It was like being showered with little dippin’ dots. We thought this was adorable, and funny. J and I figured, it’s better than rain. The little ice balls just bounced off us as we walked. Note to self, if it starts precipitating, don’t continue.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ZRAe8SbZ74I/U3G_Tc2YPVI/AAAAAAAABB4/hUXa0Y1tXlk/w504-h672-no/2014-05-10+16.16.14.jpg" alt="J in snow"></p>

<p>We got to the half-way point, 6 miles in, and snow started just pouring from the sky. It was so thick, you could barely see a few feet in front of you. Armed with only hoodies and athletic pants we trekked back. It was adventurous and stupid. We became walking snowmen, with snow sticking to our hair and cotton clothes. At some points it was like hiking through a snow globe and at other points we felt like we were stuck in the arctic.  The last mile, my body was wet with a miserable mix of sweat and snow. But looking back on it, despite the cold and the snow, it was worth it. </p>

<p>But of course, as soon as we got to the car (and brushed all the snow off of it). The sky cleared up, and the day went back to 50 degrees. At least we didn’t get snowed on day 2. :)</p>

	<p>Living in SF gives you more of an excuse to jet off to Hawaii. It&#39;s closer than New York, Boston, and Florida, and despite crossing an ocean, you don&#39;t have to suffer through customs.</p>

<p>I went recently on a three day &quot;work&quot; trip. Which is to say that work paid for the trip, but I (nor my teammates) didn&#39;t actually get any work done. </p>

<p>My team stayed at the Kaanapali Westin in Maui. The resort was kind of faux exotic. When you entered there was this giant manmade waterfalls that they had trapped a variety of wild birds and koi in. So that when you exited checkin you were greeted by flamingos and macaws chilling under a giant waterfall. It&#39;s definitely bizarre, and seemed a little trying too hard. (But yo, I still took pictures of it)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-o3xOnhPnJgc/U2V-pR5S8QI/AAAAAAAABsU/7nkH5-WUNKc/w924-h693-no/14+-+20" alt="Crazy entrance way"></p>

<p>Hawaii is a vacation spot that doesn&#39;t take much work if you&#39;re coming from the mainland. Everyone speaks the same language, your GPS works, and you don&#39;t really have to do much to have fun. While it&#39;s nice for relaxing, it can be almost too effortless. Given the lax environment, I spent a lot of my time walking along the beach, reading outside in perfect weather and just chilling.</p>

<p>I just recently moved to a new team at work, and wanted to impress my coworkers and meet people. So I probably tried too hard. I was extroverted, stayed out late, danced, introduced myself to everyone and basically made sure I met everyone. It was a nice mix of work (meeting everyone in the world, omg.) and play (laying on the beach and people watching)</p>

<p>Ultimately I got in my two favorite things in Hawaii, Acai Bowls (omg, learned to make these at home. Going to eat them forever.) and Surfing (also should do this at home, buuuuut.)</p>

	<p>A week or two ago we had a completely open day. The weather&#39;s been great, and so we wanted to get outdoors and try a new trail, stretch our legs out a bit from a long week of screens, screens and more screens.</p>

<p>So the boyfriend and I hit up Cataract Falls. When we got there it was chilly. Like, when you live in California, sometimes you forget how cold it can get. We planned the hike around a 6 mile loop that promised coastal views and ended at Cataract Falls. The coastal bit, honestly, was just so boring. Basically no elevation change, gentle weather, and mediocre views. It would have been just as good to walk on a track, or in a mall, god.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-l-G2xUF9wVI/U02toZo_udI/AAAAAAAAAQM/SmToLc4_m9I/w955-h716-no/14+-+20" alt="Alt text"></p>

<p>Five miles through, and with way too much energy left, we made it to the falls area. Not tired, we decided to tack on an extra 5 mile loop to the hike to get to the base of the waterfall and back. </p>

<p>So we took off, running down the falls trail, jumping down stairs, speedng through straight paths. I had that nagging feeling you get in the back of your mind, &quot;Hmmm, this seems like a lot of downhill.&quot; But, like an idiot, I ignored the fact that I was basically hurtling my body down a mountain.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-jj7eWdlnkg0/U02toc6YQcI/AAAAAAAAAQo/yzTdVWoy93Y/w537-h716-no/14+-+16" alt="Alt text"></p>

<p>The water was gorgeous, and made up for our lack luster hike. But fuck man, we had to climb all the way back up. 1,400 feet elevation to scale, basically 140 floors to tackle. Initially, I was dying, and expected to vomit, curl up and die (I think my boyfriend was embarrassed of me at this point. Haha). But after the first few &quot;flights&quot; of steps, my body just stopped caring.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, it sucked the whole way up. I was a disgusting sweaty mess. But I stopped taking breaks and just pushed through the bulk of it. I felt pretty bad ass. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-BZk_KutFwlo/U02toXyfGyI/AAAAAAAAAMQ/1jaox2je8G0/w955-h716-no/14+-+25" alt="Alt te"></p>

<p>We got to the top and thought we were basically done with the loop, but we still had a mile and a half to go. Longest mile and a half of our lives, we were cold, tired, and our quads were ready to fall off. When we got to the car, all I wanted to do was sit, forever.</p>

<p>We ended up ordering in and just chilling, accomplishing nothing more than a super steep 10 mile hike that day. </p>
