	<div class="date">
		October 27, 2014
	</div>

	<p>Spoiler alert. I ran Run 10 Feed 10, and I was bad. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s start from the beginning though. I woke up at 6 am to get ready for this race. I had carefully prepared all the things I needed the night before. However, my morning brain couldn&#39;t remember where I put them. So I spent like half an hour freaking out and looking for them. Good going Kay.</p>

<p>I pulled myself together, and hauled myself to Crissy Field. I was pumped. The views were beautiful. There were a ton of runners. It was good. I started snapping some quick pictures from the field of the bridge.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-JLSTgjLKqvw/VE01Eoh6K5I/AAAAAAAAMdA/4GcCJDtqWNM/w955-h716-no/IMG_4068.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>I hate subtle foreshadowing, so I&#39;m going to be obvious here. The bridge looks pretty high up from where I was taking photos. I thought nothing of that at the time. The morning was beautiful, there were cute booths. I got to put on a temporary tattoo and got prizes for taking selfies (basically my dream). The world was good.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/oPjIXWqMXULk-fHw8WGbMWHrYd6C5QZ2BOtZRre4r88=s716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Women&#39;s Health put on a killer display. There were a bunch of adorable sponsor booths. We warmed up with a very calm instructor from a local yoga studio. They had tons of photographers coming around snapping pictures, making me feel like people should always be taking pictures of my pre-run festivities. </p>

<p>They lined up the runners into different pace groups. I wanted this to be a chill run, and didn&#39;t want to feel super competitive (I did this run to take pictures of the bridge!) So I put myself in the last group.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/xb6nh2Ig8Cy7LDBk8DucHLSOfwyxFFLHAYJgAwQ2AcI=w955-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>And we started! There wasn&#39;t a lot of fanfare for this. I hit the button on my cheapo Garmin, and started my playlist that I haven&#39;t updated since Seawheeze and started running. </p>

<p>The photos of the bridge, are pretty killer. And the road was blocked off, so I didn&#39;t feel overcrowded or anything.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/g6CTli4YXS60_cK1vMpZad5XyBSXcqSPX6DzwCg5Mis=w955-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-L5PVajP060w/VE01S6Jb9sI/AAAAAAAAMfA/loE2VqAxrW4/w955-h716-no/IMG_4079.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>However. This route starts with a whole lot of uphill. Annnd. Elevation and I aren&#39;t friends. Furthermore, if you know how a bridge works, it&#39;s basically sloping up and down the entire way. </p>

<p>On my recent runs, I haven&#39;t been feeling any fatigue until mile 5 or so. On this run, 2 miles in and I was gross. Sweaty, and breathing heavy, and a real mess. While they had water at the other end of the bridge, there were not enough water stations in the world to fix and hydrate me.</p>

<p>I finished the race at an embarrassing 10:30 pace. And looked something like this at the end:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-JsWryTDmHFc/VE01ZY_WriI/AAAAAAAAMf8/Ycs-CFV6urs/w537-h716-no/IMG_4090.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>I could give you the 150 excuses I have for a bad run. But it really boils down to lack of practice. </p>

<p>That said. Run 10 Feed 10 was beautiful, and amazing. And if you get the chance to run over the Golden Gate Bridge, you should DEFINITELY do it. At the end there was a delicious bagel and fruit spread, dynamic stretching (I waited 30 minutes in line for this and it was worth every second), and a great yoga session.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-QHi6BTmArYk/VE01FndeOtI/AAAAAAAAMdI/1wjQ94KrAMY/w955-h716-no/IMG_4069.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Please, tell me of your successes this weekend. I went to the Bridge School Benefit after this, and got to feel really good about my fitbit step count all day. So all in all, not bad. :)</p>

	<p>Today was one of those days that started with the water heater not working. Unfortunately, when you’re trying to wash your hair as infrequently as possible (for its own health!) and you’re on day four or five. You have to shower. Needless to say, my day didn’t begin on a great note.</p>

<p>It was packet pickup for Run 10 Feed 10, which is a 10k by Women’s Health that crosses the Golden Gate Bridge. I’ve only ever crossed via car, and I love trashy health magazines. So J and I walked to the running store to pick up my packet.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/5_WXeAHPHW6KLkHkd8fT4pquxQxePo8tJr32dEPlCtE=w1038-h684-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Despite the fact that it’s November, we scrambled out in tshirts because the weather here is still in the 70s. It’s crazy. Halloween is in a week.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-aWwc5m7Lyg0/VEwgXHVRWcI/AAAAAAAAMag/I7F_2koYoyI/w931-h716-no/IMG_4055.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>The Run 10 Feed 10 bag was adorable. But hilariously, I’m most excited for the temporary tattoos. I missed doing the “Run Yoga Party” spray on tattoos for Seawheeze and so I’m making up for it.</p>

<p>We ended up with another free bag for Google Shopping Express (a same day delivery service in the Bay). Their logo is a parachute, and so they sent out these adorable themed bags.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-KKPCJfw6hqQ/VEwgMsKkbII/AAAAAAAAMXo/WZ4m3CEu6QI/w537-h716-no/IMG_4049.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Reusable bags are a pretty big deal here, since it costs 10 cents to buy disposable bags at any store.</p>

<p>When we got home we had already walked a bunch around the city. So I snapchatted my family really attractive faces while J worked. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-FNcJqtnk2Lw/VEwgbE_drXI/AAAAAAAAMZU/0jfKn9dQfO4/w537-h716-no/IMG_4058.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>I’ve got dinner plans and an early bedtime waiting for me tonight. (Race starts at 7:30ish) Eugggh. </p>

<p>What’s the best swag you ever got? (I hope it’s not temporary tattoos, otherwise, we gotta talk.)</p>

	<p>No real update today babes. I had one of those days at work where you’re cranking things out so hard that you don’t realize you’ve been there ten hours. </p>

<p>The weekend is going to be a straight up blast though. Women’s Health 10k, on Sunday, and Bridge School Benefit too. </p>

<p>The only adorable part of my day came in the form of lunch. Work was celebrating breast cancer awareness. So they did a beet paper (pink) wrapped sushi roll. With a salad, and some indian inspired cabbage dish, they were a pretty fantastic lunch.</p>

	<h1><a href="/10-23-2014/motivation.html">What’s your motivation?</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		October 23, 2014
	</div>

	<p>At 5:30 pm, after a 9 hour day of standing (I have a lovely standing desk), looking at a computer screen, and typing, the last thing I want to do is go run, or exercise in general.</p>

<p>And then my brain starts telling me. “Oh, you don’t need to run. You have… work. You’re… tired. You could… spend this time better.” And it takes a lot of work, some will power and a few tricks to get myself here:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/3f1JmkMPH6r8vXm5xiiDYymZwE3rDdIYEdxI9f6XLKg=w955-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>(Seriously this is one of the few times I cared enough in the morning to put on matching socks. Usually I have like, one lime sock and one purple one.)</p>

<p>I’ve been working on a few tricks to get myself to keep ignoring the lazy person inside of me:</p>

<h2>1. Buy myself things for doing exercise</h2>

<p>Childish perhaps. And consumeristic, but very effective. Usually, I set some sort of goal, like: “Exercise 5 days this week”. This week (given I work out tomorrow) I’m buying </p>

<p><a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/167820434/day-of-the-dead-boston-terrier-sugar"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-piTRIVkYqxQ/VEm-JxvgxFI/AAAAAAAAMVw/FLjZze7szn0/w570-h544-no/diadelosdog.jpg" alt=""></a></p>

<h2>2. Keep everything I need to workout at my desk</h2>

<p>Everyone in my building has a little file cabinet. And while most people keep extra work supplies in them (one of my coworkers keeps his full of listerine), I keep a bunch of shirts, a spare pair of tennis shoes, socks and hairbands in them. So I can always get from work appropriate to workout appropriate.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-KEi93M6r840/U-KsUJ8tcrI/AAAAAAAAE2k/H9NScVWwhrc/w537-h716-no/IMG_1863.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>(Things I wouldn’t mind putting in my file cabinet. If I had more money, and I trekked up the the Nike store more often.)</p>

<h2>3. Brag</h2>

<p>No one likes the self righteous exerciser. But I have a few key friends who put up with my boasting because they know if I keep up on staying fit, I’m a more sane person. And I’m always open to them when they want to hit me up about their latest sweat sesh.</p>

<p>Even with all of this, sometimes fitness still falls by the wayside. What’s your trick to keeping motivated?</p>
