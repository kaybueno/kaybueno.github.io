<p>It’s <a href="http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2014/12/11/bayareastorm-best-social-media-posts-capture-rain-wind-and-flooding/">pouring in the Bay Area</a> right now. Fortunately, I was able to make it to work without a canoe. Unfortunately, most of my coworkers would have needed some sort of water transportation to get here, and so, I’m nearly alone in the office (I count 15 people, usually there are ~200). </p>

<p>On the bright side, my work is super cool, and so today, we converted one of the office spaces into a skating rink. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-74mQhc9RIkY/VIojEOpknFI/AAAAAAAAQVY/t1EQkJkMyg0/w202-h358-no/skategif.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>I cannot contain my excitement. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-7YWJeohmnqw/VIoZ-EaH_zI/AAAAAAAAQUw/VJxC-hCzdwU/w1033-h775-no/IMG_5122.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>The “rink”.</p>

<p>So, first things first. It’s technically not “ice”. It’s a polymer, that they cover with vegetable oil, to make a slick skating surface. When you’re on it, it’s a lot less slippery than ice. I stepped on expecting to immediately bite it, but instead, I spent 10 minutes waddling around trying to figure out how hard I had to push to skate. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-m93QyKE7PAU/VIolvZgq5HI/AAAAAAAAQVs/pM2_DI11qUQ/w359-h202-no/skating2.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>My coworker figured out the mechanics a lot faster than me. </p>

<p>It was actually a lot more tiring than it looks, because it’s not ice, you have to use a lot of effort to get enough momentum to skate. </p>

<p>Between the fake snow, the pop-up ice rink, and the churros and mexican hot chocolate provided, we had a blast. At one point my team even had the whole rink to ourselves. It made me want to head out to a real ice rink this winter.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/g23oRQyY1tqctjRYnAwO-Na2mTJ9mZ-zVE9BxndYFoO0=w915-h1220-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Another image of me being excessively excited. When you live in an area that never feels like winter. (It’s a balmy 60 degrees with rain), it’s nice to have a little fake snow and ice to make it feel like the holidays. </p>

<p>How’s your workday (or home day) going? Are you good at skating? </p>

	<p>Woah, it’s almost Christmas. </p>

<p>Lately, I’ve been a blur of holiday shopping, project finishing, and Christmas partying this week (J and I have a holiday bash every night this week from Wednesday on. Since they’re all through work, it’s a lot of free delicious food and booze around. Yum, and also yikes!)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-_BZBuJgFq_s/VIf3a9BKLhI/AAAAAAAAQJk/lEyrZkgoGb4/s672-no/holidayparty.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>A friend and I from last year’s holiday party. It’s my one excuse to wear a gorgeous dress in San Francisco. I’ll definitely be snapping photos this year too. </p>

<p>But I wanted to step away from the December madness to bring you what I’m eating before all these festivities. So let’s get down to the <a href="http://peasandcrayons.com/2014/12/ate-wednesday-party-203.html">Wednesday eats</a>. </p>

<p>Breakfast is back with the best bagged eggs I’ve ever had. This is actually my most solid breakfast. I sometimes switch it up with the work buffet breakfast (usually a vegan pancake, eggs, and a slice of bacon.)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ZSGU7kRbZXw/VIfzYmjuOzI/AAAAAAAAQII/jW07GwjHfa0/w832-h672-no/IMG_5087.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Least sexy picture of the year award goes to my lunch. Lately, my goal has been to eat more vegetables. So the solution, and trick to this, is to always eat whatever my lunch is, over a salad. I have a bunch of friends who do this, and I just never caught on. However, it makes my pie-less chicken pot pie look rather unappetizing. Despite its looks, it was delicious.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/sswe8KyKllXY4ZRPFM8QXh4vnhoBfOByiW-hpjJXeAnW=w807-h672-no" alt=""></p>

<p>In this photo, I&#39;m straight up clawing my afternoon snack. I’ve been craving chocolate lately, and this chocolate covered coconut snack is amazing, and in small enough portions that I don’t eat an entire coconut’s worth. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/5bVQvp7q5p5osMWowky1lKUkBJ8S7cMBWO-VL-FM7OQg=s672-no" alt=""></p>

<p>I’m not much of a dinner person, but I met up with a friend for the vietnamese version of Chipotle. Which features yet another salad. Totally delicious. J and I have had this once before, and I literally can recommend everything I’ve had provided you like avocado, jalapeno, cilantro and pineapple. :)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/jakvuyWrhayTazahy7L1dtx1azaGvUDd3s5cIjE-ebC_=w896-h672-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Not a bad day! I think I’m due to eliminate some more sugar from my everyday eats, but otherwise I’m more satisfied with the food I’m sharing.</p>

<p>I definitely need to sit down and write some more things up. I recently got eyelash extensions (love), am decorating my teeny tiny apartment’s exterior for a contents (bring on the washi tape), and hit up a giant craft fair with a bunch of friends.</p>

<p>Are you prepared for the holidays? Any killer parties, or traditions I should start? I think I need to start a baking list for when I go back home. Anything (healthy, or less healthy) I should look into? :)</p>

	<div class="date">

	</div>

	<p>If you’ve looked at your calendar, or don’t live under a rock, you know that Thanksgiving has already passed us by. But today, at work, I was grabbing lunch with a friend who works on the events team. In a nutshell, her job is to throw super amazing parties, lunches, and holiday celebrations for the company. Despite all the perks of her job (getting attend lavish parties, sweet relationships with cool vendors, etc), she told me she feels best about what she does when people thank her. </p>

<p>And it made me realize, omg, I never even sat down and thought about all the things, and more importantly people, I’m grateful for this year. Fortunately <a href="http://blog.hioscar.com/post/103736729575/we-are-thankful">Oscar Insurance</a> reached out to me to ask me what I’m thankful about, and inspired me with the hashtag #WeAreThankful.</p>

<p>So let&#39;s talk gratitude: </p>

<h2>1. Family (and the fact they put up with me).</h2>

<p>I convinced the family this year to do a 5k after the holidays. And even though my brother has a surgery coming up in the next few weeks, he was <strong>still</strong> down to do it. They definitely have my back.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-BPJl219cm9I/VHpZ0i19_JI/AAAAAAAAPiI/kwl7XJAtN1Q/w955-h716-no/IMG_4925.JPG" alt="Family from the ugly sweater race"></p>

<h2>2. Figuring out my health. </h2>

<p>Before this year, I had never run a half, a 10k, or even a real 5k. I hadn’t ever gone to yoga more than an errant time or two. I liked hiking, biking, and sports. But I avoided so many things for fear of being bad at them. This last year, I stopped worrying about looking silly trying something new.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/npoqIOVPC3Lo2xFyeAOs3M_6uqB5N6AUc9uUOfKFT3I=w520-h716-no" alt="Kay stretching"></p>

<h2>3. Duh. J.</h2>

<p>He actually coded most of this blog, takes a bunch of the pictures, and goes along with 90% of the things I do. (Still can’t convince him into yoga. :( ) He’s basically the coolest person I know. I haven’t killed him after a 3 week road trip, him teaching me to ski, or even after he told me I had a “pizza belly” a few nights ago. So basically it’s love.</p>

<p>Sometimes (maybe most of the time) I’m a terrible blogger. I take bad quality iPhone pictures, neglect to post, and even sometimes let my comments build up forever. But this blog has also been the coolest thing ever. I take more pictures, I’ve tried new things, and I’ve met the most fun people ever just by being on the internet. I’m thankful for everyone who reads this, and all the really amazing ladies I comment back and forth with. You guys make the good old world wide web fun. :)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-__2-Y1MZaLI/VGmVwk204DI/AAAAAAAAOwg/ZXia62frizA/w955-h716-no/2014-11-16.jpg" alt="This blog"></p>

<p>I’m thankful for a lot more things (like the good old job, the fact that I can get my hands on the ground in a forward fold, and that my eyeliner looks pretty darn good most days.) And it’s important to consider all the things we’re grateful for before we step into the busiest, and most consumeristic time of the year. (No judgement here, I’m straight up buying everything this Christmas.)</p>

<p>Even though we’ve already eaten all the turkey, cranberry sauce, and paleo pumpkin pie (j/k, maybe), what are you thankful for?</p>

	<p>I wasn’t one of those amazing people who only indulged a little over Thanksgiving break. I wasn’t even one of those amazing people who only indulged over Thanksgiving. When I went home, it was serious sugar coma, food party, every single day. And it was amazing.</p>

<p>I made, and ate a bunch of <a href="http://www.averiecooks.com/2013/10/candy-corn-and-white-chocolate-softbatch-cookies.html">these</a> cookies.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/JX0-DdzwpBC0TUVK9XTWfPyipt7LmKqmY4jLAiPdnJY=w955-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>But by the last day I was pretty beat. I was feeling pretty sluggish, sleepy, and fat. So I’ve been trying to tighten up my weekly eats to balance out all my dirty habits. (Also, full disclosure, my brother is proposing to his girlfriend, there’s gonna be a wedding. I want to look good in the photos next year!)</p>

<p>So here&#39;s what I ate <a href="http://peasandcrayons.com/2014/12/ate-wednesday-202.html">Wednesday</a>.</p>

<p>Breakfast was this mondo cup of coffee, (necessary), some hardboiled eggs (which look very very plain in a white bowl), and a pink lady apple. I love and hate this breakfast. Love the way it makes me feel, hate that it’s sooooo boring.</p>

<p>Fancy soup. This was…. carrot ginger I think. I’ve been eating a bunch of soup. My bad.</p>

<p>My drink of choice lately. Hint fizz. This stuff, this is the best cold drink lately (peppermint tea being the best hot drink.) If you’re in the Bay Area, or really anywhere, you should try this. It’s like, bottled spa water.</p>

<p>My snack. These nuts are… meh. I want to whip up some energy bites or something this week to replace these guys. I’m just not a peanut person. Why eat peanuts when you could have cashews, almonds, or macadamia nuts? Idk man.</p>

<p>Dinner was another salad with pulled pork. But I was lazy, and talking to people so I didn’t snap a photo.</p>

<p>Unrelated to eats. But I’ve been listening to this a bunch while getting ready or working. To be frank, it’s officially because it’s my boyfriend’s band playing it. But if you like the garage rock type of sound, it’s worth a listen. Otherwise abort. Honestly. I mostly listen to pop and like maybe venture into indie when I’m feeling daring. I always feel a little more cultured when I go to a show with J, or listen to something outside my listening comfort zone.</p>

<p>Do you switch your food up, or do you eat the same thing every day? What are you listening to that I should listen to? (Hint, if it’s Hozier, I’m allllllready listening. :) )</p>
