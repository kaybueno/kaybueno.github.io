	<p>Last week a coworker told me the Guiness Book of World Record&#39;s <a href="www.coolpatchpumpkins.com">largest corn maze</a> was just an hour away from San Francisco. 60 acres of corn confusion. </p>

<p>Not one to turn down a challenge (especially a challenge that closed this weekend), J and I got a group of friends together and spent most of our Saturday getting lost.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/BclFfC7sjODxIIxS1Mt03LN4eTnV_uTFXjs14v8zY5s=w955-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-BGtLWvbujb8/VGAO92BKY_I/AAAAAAAANrY/AhewLFpUbIc/w955-h716-no/IMG_4417.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>The course is broken up into four different platforms, each of which runs you through a different type of maze. The first is made up of concentric circles, the second a square grid like pattern, the third, a squiggly leaf-like pattern, and the fourth a cross hatched mess. The map and course have numerical and alphabetical coordinates (e.g. L23) to try to find where you are on the map.</p>

<p>We ran into the maze foolish. In the beginning we decided not to use the map they gave us. However, after following the same circle over and over again, we took a different approach.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-DPXiwJ0K0I4/VF-c4nsPteI/AAAAAAAANk0/bntHV6PcFfs/w537-h716-no/IMG_4385.JPG" alt="j trying to find the top"></p>

<p>However, even after hoisting J up, we couldn&#39;t find an easy way to the first base. After some splitting up and Marco Polo, we finally made it to the first platform.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-imHjazHhu3o/VF-eMauduwI/AAAAAAAANlM/qHEOPYff8VM/w955-h716-no/IMG_4387.JPG" alt="found the first base"></p>

<p>At this point, looking at the corn field, we realized we couldn&#39;t really keep going without a map, or we&#39;d be in the maze until it closed at 10pm. So we made it a game, and promised only to look every 3 minutes.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/hf7i36-Hl__jts6BQP62B3puc0P8hNwURpykZ8Aui7A=w1038-h630-no" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-P5uIdvOJ9QA/VGLWrfeb6II/AAAAAAAAN6A/YnVTZj2YT04/w537-h716-no/findtheway.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>With this tactic we got through the next two platforms much quicker. At the third platform though, despite the smiles here, we were kind of over tramping through corn. It turns out, unlike on a hike, a corn maze doesn&#39;t look much different at any point. I had my fitbit on, and we were reaching mile 6 of walking through the maze. That&#39;s a lot of corn.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-jP-mgKj2f1c/VGAOr9mstdI/AAAAAAAANps/yPZjSsZwGQ8/w955-h716-no/IMG_4408.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>We finally made it out at this tiny wooden bridge. We were so happy to have escaped the maze. But J was disappointed, because they weren&#39;t running their hay ride.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-mo5PR3SXYV8/VGAPPdsebxI/AAAAAAAANtU/6lE5ZF28Pwk/w955-h716-no/IMG_4427.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>So the boys made their own. I was simultaneously embarrassed (because they took over a random wagon and were running around the parking lot), and pleased, because come on, it&#39;s adorable.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-fbymk21vmwY/VGAPWtJ8e_I/AAAAAAAAN2E/SyAG6rlRTKY/w1038-h522-no/IMG_4433.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>All in all the maze would have been the best ever if it was about half the length. By end we were pretty exhausted, and sick of seeing corn, and all we wanted was to pee and eat In-n-Out. Both of which we did. </p>

<p>What&#39;s the craziest (or dumbest) thing you&#39;ve done lately?</p>

	<p>It was one of those weekends, where you end up doing so much, you want another weekend after to relax. (In a good way!) It&#39;s still in the 60s and 70s in the Bay, so I&#39;m trying to get out as much as possible before the fog rolls in.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/IC98GPe5mrTvPu2AD06dOdlpWi8aXf-62bp2IUsEOBs=w860-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>We completed the Guinness Book of World Record’s <a href="www.coolpatchpumpkins.com">longest corn maze</a>. That map. That map is the maze. We died a little inside completing it, but we conquered the corn.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-B76phZNHMalKnkbUFmnJRr2xqDROYiZ375T-ngbWQo=w1038-h522-no" alt=""></p>

<p>J really wanted a hay ride to celebrate his corn maze completion. Unfortunately there wasn’t one. So we made our own. Corn Maze - 0, Kay and friends - 1.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Zr8h4rbF_K8/VGBHjDUlpQI/AAAAAAAAN1w/pv4jcBm7KZY/w696-h672-no/IMG_4454.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p><a href="www.almostgettingittogether.com">Cassie</a> and I hung out again. It was, in a word, magical. If you don’t have a friend you can sweat with, vent to, and eat delicious food with. I totally suggest finding one.</p>

<p>I took my first Surf Set class. Love at first wipe out. </p>

<p>I want to tell you all more about it (and I will later this week!), but I had to brag a little about my weekend while I’m still so pumped from it. :)</p>

<p>How was your weekend? Try anything new?</p>

	<p>Today has been one of those days where all I want to do is treat myself. I may or may not have signed up for a subscription box, bought new shoes, and considered the finer points of owning adorable, hand crafted, <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/172817839/custom-text-cute-cat-mug-white-black">cat-shaped mugs</a> from Etsy. (I have yet to buy the kitty mugs, but give it a day.) </p>

<p>While I love to get packages in the mail (does anyone not like getting packages in the mail?), I sometimes don’t love paying for all those packages. So my goal? Buy really cheap things I love, that still get mailed to me. All the good feelings, none--- less of the guilt. :)</p>

<p>So recently I bought a pack of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00O71O8XS">flash tattoos</a> on Amazon.</p>

<p>Flash tattoos were everywhere this summer, if you watched basically any bad reality tv. They look amazing on a tan. But. Since I don’t have a tan at any point of the year. There’s no time like the present to hop on the bandwagon.</p>

<p>I impulse ordered a set from Amazon. They were 12 dollars for 5 sheets, and were prime eligible. So I got my greedy hands on them super fast.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/LvL5zMAOFlW0PcvY4Lg9U4rAFppGv87jhGbmXHHGjUs=s873-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Bam. All 5 sheets, with extra filters. For those of you who also can’t lay off the <a href="http://www.instagram.com/kay_bueno">instagram</a>.</p>

<p>My boss actually picked them up out of the mailroom for me, (The first 6 letters of our last names are identical. So his mailbox is next to mine) and asked what they were for. Having no shame, I told my boss (who is a super uncool, but amazing dad type), that they were temporary tattoos for adults. </p>

<p>He laughed at me. </p>

<p>So I started small for work wear. I went with these guys.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-2DBLKelcaYE/VFuxME5kOuI/AAAAAAAANYo/Oi0ULozcrc8/w873-h540-no/IMG_4273.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>A little ring, and one of the teeny tiny flowers.</p>

<p>Now I won’t show you how to apply these guys, because it’s basically fool proof. Cut out the tattoo, pull off the plastic, stick it wherever, wet, and go. (Actually, for complete honesty. I would do this somewhere you’re hairless. I definitely may or may not have quickly removed some errant knuckle hairs before doing this).</p>

<p>I will tell you, full disclosure, that I definitely forgot to take off the plastic the first time I did this. Don’t forget that step. It ruins it. Womp womp. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-36XISQQEM6U/VFuyJbo6W0I/AAAAAAAANZ4/m1mY4kHEw1k/w873-h664-no/IMG_4340.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>I know you really wanted to see straight up my nose for this. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-RT3LIEsHliw/VFuxlpaczJI/AAAAAAAANac/FyYn6YImxtA/w573-h878-no/IMG_4302.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Lighting is hard guys. </p>

<p>But! I swear it’s the end of too close for comfort selfies. It’s just really hard to photograph your fourth knuckle if you’re not like, posing for super cute engagement photos or something.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Uvaa8UJLt6PcDTYD2No04k3ar8G05jOf0A21LiIX5lU=w873-h1164-no" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/TA4VeXV12mVV15HV_8u5emgOix_zvMI--jq68z9yo3s=w873-h905-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Great. Now that we all can pick my individual body parts out of a line up. </p>

<p>They turned out pretty great. No one at work thought they were crazy, in fact, only two girls who stood in line for coffee noticed them. The staying power of the ring has been great. Unfortunately, the little flower-y dude has completely rubbed off. I do a lot of index finger work I guess…</p>

<p>All in all. I plan on buying more (if they still stay cool) to put alongside whatever else I make at  at Christmas and give to those girlfriends who maybe aren’t your bffs, but still are gift worthy. :)</p>

<p>And, at 5 pages of tattoos, for 12 bucks, in two days. You end up paying less than 20 cents a tattoo. Not bad Kay. Not bad.</p>

<p>What are you splurging (or saving!) on lately?</p>

<p><em>Because disclaimers are cool. I wasn’t compensated in any way by the random Amazon company I bought these from. In fact, they probably don’t even know I’m alive.</em></p>

	<p>Do you ever wonder what people will think of us in 500 years? I had this exact thought this morning. What would a cultural anthropologist a few hundred years from now think of the fact that every Wednesday, a bunch of people post stylized pictures of what they ate that day? </p>

<p>In spite of the fact that researchers in the future will probably think I’m part of a weird food posting cult, and also judge me for eating packaged eggs. I’m still here to report on the things I ate on my <a href="http://peasandcrayons.com/">Wednesday</a>. </p>

<p>Here goes breakfast. Coffee. Kiwi. And the Wilcox bag? That’s two hardboiled eggs. They’re delicious. Judge away.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/bzQ_TbxCbziq7eDjXDYVQxKDznYG3LyNeJ90AoZjHqk=w873-h726-no" alt="Breakfast"></p>

<p>Pardon the lunch shot. I’m still not quite comfortable announcing to my coworkers that I’m going to be photographing my food. But I made a grilled veggie and chicken sandwich and paired it with a macaroni and chickpea soup in a vegetable-tomato broth.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ZezR8-0q7r_o2tyq6jWolba07qwWW2sDypdqDf87av4=w873-h655-no" alt=""></p>

<p>This apple doesn’t look anywhere to actual scale of an apple. But it was my post lunch snack.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/AZfszO_GsXvibP3rk6uRNqq-uM6jgq_Ikq5xGP0AD1g=w873-h863-no" alt="Giant picture of an apple"></p>

<p>Work brought around these cups of chia seed pudding. They were unreal. Diced mango, chia seeds, coconut milk, agave, and mint. Delicious. I may or may not try to recreate this it was so good.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/R33nSfWkH7PN0zsngTEE6oCGWseqWDatIarqpq7ECuc=s873-no" alt="Chia pudding"></p>

<p>It’s not dinner yet here. But I’ll probably snack on something at home. I’m not a big late meal person. I tend to sleep better when I eat less at night.</p>

<p>What&#39;s your current snacking fave? I&#39;m looking for something new. All my summer snacks seem <em>so wrong</em> when we&#39;re approaching winter. </p>
