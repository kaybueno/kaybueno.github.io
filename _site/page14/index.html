	<h1><a href="/11-5-2014/WIAW.html">What I ate Wednesday</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		November 5, 2014
	</div>

	<p>Do you ever wonder what people will think of us in 500 years? I had this exact thought this morning. What would a cultural anthropologist a few hundred years from now think of the fact that every Wednesday, a bunch of people post stylized pictures of what they ate that day? </p>

<p>In spite of the fact that researchers in the future will probably think I’m part of a weird food posting cult, and also judge me for eating packaged eggs. I’m still here to report on the things I ate on my <a href="http://peasandcrayons.com/">Wednesday</a>. </p>

<p>Here goes breakfast. Coffee. Kiwi. And the Wilcox bag? That’s two hardboiled eggs. They’re delicious. Judge away.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/bzQ_TbxCbziq7eDjXDYVQxKDznYG3LyNeJ90AoZjHqk=w873-h726-no" alt="Breakfast"></p>

<p>Pardon the lunch shot. I’m still not quite comfortable announcing to my coworkers that I’m going to be photographing my food. But I made a grilled veggie and chicken sandwich and paired it with a macaroni and chickpea soup in a vegetable-tomato broth.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ZezR8-0q7r_o2tyq6jWolba07qwWW2sDypdqDf87av4=w873-h655-no" alt=""></p>

<p>This apple doesn’t look anywhere to actual scale of an apple. But it was my post lunch snack.</p>

<p>Work brought around these cups of chia seed pudding. They were unreal. Diced mango, chia seeds, coconut milk, agave, and mint. Delicious. I may or may not try to recreate this it was so good.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/R33nSfWkH7PN0zsngTEE6oCGWseqWDatIarqpq7ECuc=s873-no" alt="Chia pudding"></p>

<p>It’s not dinner yet here. But I’ll probably snack on something at home. I’m not a big late meal person. I tend to sleep better when I eat less at night.</p>

<p>What&#39;s your current snacking fave? I&#39;m looking for something new. All my summer snacks seem <em>so wrong</em> when we&#39;re approaching winter. </p>

	<h1><a href="/11-4-2014/castle-rock.html">Castle Rock State Park.</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		November 4, 2014
	</div>

	<p>When it gets dark at 5 pm, there’s basically no chance for me to get out during daylight. </p>

<p>So I’ve been daydreaming about what life would be like without daylight savings, and reminiscing to a hike J and I did a few days before the time changed. </p>

<p>Castle Rock State Park is one of my favorite places to hike, even though it’s probably better known for it’s rock climbing, bouldering, belaying, rappelling and more. :)</p>

<p>But I love it for the views</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-doBmHF1zScGvwo9FfVpWFeeRgtq2pdaPrc65HetTYY=w1038-h454-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Castle Rock’s trails actually connects to the ones at Big Basin, so you can easily hike for 30+ miles. But J and I traditionally do the Saratoga Gap trail to the Castle Rock camp grounds and then back through the ridge trail past Goat Rock. Which is a really detailed way of saying we hike for 6-7 miles. :)</p>

<p>Saratoga Gap puts you on an exposed ridge where you do a lot of scrambling up and around rocks to keep hiking. It’s probably medium strenuous. Like, we haven’t taken J’s parents, but any of our friends could rock the route.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-uYzP2Anu9jg/VDtjmdpnxXI/AAAAAAAALr8/xMeCrGFJ4-c/w955-h716-no/IMG_3838.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>My favorite part is that all the rocks are fair game. You see people like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/WKQ2bdXxrAU-B-1j-jhS3b9om1KncGZu4NJn7lRPBRM=w1038-h685-no" alt="top of the rock dude rapelling"></p>

<p>Or just J and I climbing around on small 15 foot rock formations.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-lD1IuOS6uTE/VDtj-2xuBRI/AAAAAAAALvI/D4LssBlYwuc/w955-h716-no/IMG_3855.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Not to be left out of my own blog, I took a selfie or two during the hike.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/6kYbmHltTvkWkTcrLwFhcrUF6fQd-PcIyqxtNkohgMg=w537-h716-no" alt="K mid hike"></p>

<p>J and I eventually want to backpack here, because it’s one of our favorite South Bay hikes of all time. </p>

<p>How’s the time change treating you? Have you still been getting outside?</p>

	<h1><a href="/11-3-2014/halloween-ugly.html">Halloween Weekend, the ugly and the not so ugly.</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		November 3, 2014
	</div>

	<p>I’ve never been the type of person to have a ton of school spirit, or any type of spirit. I wasn’t the kid who dressed up for football games, or Halloween, or events or conventions. I don’t begrudge those who do, on the contrary. I’m a little jealous. I wish I could put something amazing together for every holiday, and pull it off. </p>

<p>Fortunately, J’s the same. Except, this year we had a Halloween party that we had to have costumes for. And I found this out… 2 days before. So I threw together a costume of things I had in my house.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/prZ9iCOhLt60TCYlLsDZykOuOJoIgOeQT8kFXvuMY7s=w493-h716-no" alt="K costume"></p>

<p>A white t-shirt, brown eyeshadow, lipstick, food coloring and corn syrup came together for a pretty serious zombie. Work loved it, but a few coworkers freaked out. Definitely an ugly costume, and not the traditional sexy one.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-mRxBHp7sSlM/VFPI0AcgesI/AAAAAAAAM0o/vbIcGWlQVEI/s716-no/IMG_4167-MIX.jpg" alt="K panel"></p>

<p>It worked great with J. His hazmat suit (a legit Amazon purchase) and my seriously ill zombie were couples costumes without being like, Peanut Butter and Jelly.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/wTNjCJT-fdipjaZbB_r8xjW3yY5PzMfou4rC0Qd8VGY=w598-h716-no" alt="j costume"></p>

<p>But my whole weekend wasn’t spent sitting in sticky corn syrup blood and heavy makeup.</p>

<p>I had a nail appointment with the best salon in San Francisco. Legit, I’ve tried at least 4 different salons with gels. Every single one I had cracking by the third day. And they do gel nail art. Shakira at <a href="http://sparklesanfrancisco.com/">Sparkle</a> is my fave. I seriously shell out for her every single month. That’s how long her nails last. An entire month. (If you don’t mind some grow out!)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-JoJlJYYi3fA/VFbUZ_kn3hI/AAAAAAAAM6w/jK3tqKK3tus/s716-no/IMG_4202.JPG" alt="nails"></p>

<p>The only thing as good looking as my nails, was chilling with <a href="http://almostgettingittogether.com/">Cassie</a>. We got the most beautiful beet salads ever at <a href="http://www.bluebarngourmet.com/">Blue Barn</a>. Seriously. I want to eat this every day of my life now. Forever and always.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/gJN3vD6H38xqIcN9VEz16Q3PJ7RLm131hjrrzOLcU7g=w955-h716-no" alt="salad"></p>

<p>Not to make it look like my entire Sunday was food, but between coffee and lunch we stopped at the Fort Mason Farmer’s Market. Super adorable. I bought some candied walnuts and walnut butter from a stand by <a href="http://olddogranch.com/">Old Dog Ranch</a>. The candied walnuts were just okay, but the maple walnut butter was out of this world. I got a mini jar, and thank god, because I’m literally like half way through it one day later.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/mXL7lgkbuGFTvco6wdyb8bOkVKoig4iGLEJB9goD4b8=w955-h716-no" alt="farmers market"></p>

<p>It was the coolest weekend, and I’m only sad I didn’t take more pictures! Now it’s back to work, and writing interview feedback while watching How to Get Away with Murder.</p>

<p>That said, while the start of the week sometimes sucks on the work horizon, I love using it to structure the other five days. I’m hoping to get a bunch of yoga and running in this week. Hold me to it. </p>

<p>What’re your goals for the week? </p>

	<div class="date">

	</div>

	<p>Being off routine is hard. And I’ve been out of whack this week.</p>

<p>I flew Monday night into Baltimore. Drove to Maryland. Slept for 4 hours, and then woke up to interview a bunch of awesome students. The campus was gorgeous</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/uJv3RlnS1it3oYHYZRGTuHXcscFOxEIGOYvROXTec00=w707-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>I finally felt like I was experiencing fall.</p>

<p>Then I flew back Wednesday and had a lot of work waiting for me. I’ve basically been holed up at my desk and home until today when I helped with the company Halloween party.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/QUkuFwp9oNoOEC8oRpm1-2Cq3_dG5zhct5toSqgO1Jo=w1038-h607-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Now I’m putting together a last minute zombie costume. (Oh god)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ypQXQHDhJQYLsLtzWVWDVwrOjl0KtjKilkOpygokiQ0=w501-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Mixing up some fake blood as we speak. </p>

<p>What are your weekend plans? Halloween parties anyone?</p>
