	<p>Fridays are always sweeter when you have a 3 day weekend after them. </p>

<p>With a little extra time, J and I wanted to get out of the city for at least one night, so we&#39;re driving to Napa to get in a long bike ride and some wine tastings. Even Napa’s highways have bike lanes, so it’s one of my favorite places to cycle.</p>

<div class="caption">Great outdoor patio, but we went because the winery looked casual enough for bikes.</div></p>

<p>New Year, New You, and all that. But New Year, New Vacations is where I’m at this week. I’ve been trying to make light plans to see family, friends, and get in some more great hikes. I might try to convince J to go to Utah again. But we’re leaning toward southeast Asia this year.</p>

<p>My sister gifted me a grinder and some fancy coffee, so lately I’ve been trying to class it up and use a french press. If nothing else, it makes me feel way better about my morning. Also, I’m slowly collecting all the mugs I can. It’s probably my worst impulse purchase. At this moment, my apartment has more mugs than plates. Oops!</p>

<p>I really need to make an appointment to get my lashes done again. When I saw this picture in my feed, it reminded me of why I do it. </p>

<p>Not affiliated with them or anything, but as the laziest person ever. I book literally every beauty appointment on <a href="www.styleseat.com">Style Seat</a>. It&#39;s nice to keep my hair, eyelashes, and manicure appointments all in one place. And since I’m the worst at calling places, this is arguably my favorite start-up.</p>

<div class="caption">Best appointment ever, I sleep for two hours and wake up to lashes like this.</div></p>

<p>I finally booked a hotel for SeaWheeze. I’m staying at the Pan Pacific with the madre. Last year, I left this until the last minute and I was a wreck. Everything was like 600 dollars a night if you wanted to be anywhere within walking distance to the race. I finally discovered a <a href="http://ocanadahouse.com/">bed and breakfast</a>, which I’d strongly recommend, mom and I loved it. </p>

<p>But this year, I got an earlier start, and a great deal on <a href="www.hotwire.com">Hotwire</a>, which puts us much closer to the starting line, and more importantly the showcase store. :) </p>

<div class="caption">I&#39;m mentally preparing for this madness again. :) </div></p>

<p>What are you looking forward to this weekend? Have you ever used Hotwire before? Honestly, it scared me a little not knowing what hotel you&#39;ll get when you book, but it was also kind of thrilling to find out.</p>
