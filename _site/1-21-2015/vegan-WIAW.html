	<h1><a href="">What I ate Wednesday, Vegan Exploration!</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">

	<p><a href="http://www.kaybueno.com/1-14-2015/WIAW.html">Last week</a>, I felt like my WIAW were becoming predictable. I think if I took another picture of oatmeal, or bagged eggs, my iPhone camera was going to revolt. In order to keep my sanity, and make sure my camera roll wasn’t full up of the same pictures shot every Tuesday. I decided to try different eating styles for <a href="www.peasandcrayons.com">WIAW</a>.</p>

<p>This Wednesday I decided to explore what it’s like to be a Vegan. Obviously, doing something for one day doesn’t produce a lot of mindblowing outcomes, and there’s no before/after. I figured it would get me out of a food rut and make me try something new. My goal was to not show you my usual week made vegan, but to try to go “all in” and pick the food I felt best fit the diet. </p>

<p>Today, I ran in late after helping bandage up J’s wounds, so I didn’t have time to grab breakfast from a cafe. It was a little hard to avoid the call of eggs and yogurt, my usual morning staples. But I found a perfectly ripe banana and some Justin’s and combined.</p>

<p>I only have the before picture, but I cut the banana in half and spread the peanut butter inside. Enough of my co-workers walked by and joked that I didn’t have a future in surgery, so you just get this:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-YHWB5kyPtD0/VL7tpPMqSxI/AAAAAAAAUTs/J9xnVuuzGYs/w600-h500-no/15%2B-%2B1" alt="banana and peanut butter"></p>

<p>One of my concerns about taking a vegan day at work was that I’d spend the day eating side dishes, and never feel full. Fortunately, I found a cafe that had quite a few solid vegan entrees. I’m terrible at deciding, so I picked two dishes, figuring I could just eat half of each.</p>

<p>I ate all of both.</p>

<p>The first was an Eggplant Caponata, Pine Nuts, and Whole Wheat Pita with Celery Salad and Mustard Seed Vinaigrette</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-2Pxn4GmtYhU/VL7JC9SWZgI/AAAAAAAAUOo/tghkRrr0y8I/w955-h716-no/IMG_6290.JPG" alt="Eggplant Caponata"></p>

<p>My other lunch portion was Kyuri Zuke, Avocado, and Shiso Flake Maki, with Yuzu &amp; Pepper Edamame. Basically, a fancy way of saying pickled cucumber and avocado sushi rolls. Before today I’d probably have told you it’s not sushi without raw fish, old me was wrong, these were delicious.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/--avHlV6xRKo/VL7yQU69NfI/AAAAAAAAUVI/ksJR4fGuG_M/w600-h500-no/15%2B-%2B1" alt="sushi"></p>

<p>I purchased a three month subscription from <a href="http://www.urthbox.com/">UrthBox</a> of healthy snacks. (Side note: I think UrthBox is good but expensive, they’ve had deals on Gilt City a lot lately) Quite a few were vegan. So I grabbed these fruit chews. </p>

<p>At first, I thought, “These aren’t much different than Starbursts!”. Then I found out, Starbursts aren’t vegan. Though some varieties appear not to have gelatin, it seems many incorporate Shellac in their confectioner’s glaze, which is derived from insects.</p>

<p>So given that, these were pretty fantastic.</p>

<p>J wanted to get out of the house for a little bit, so we went out and grabbed a quick dinner at a local indian fusion restaurant. They were super sweet and had tons of vegan options and substitutions. I ended up with a combo platter. Dark lighting but amazing meal.</p>

<p><strong>How did I feel?</strong> </p>

<p>I definitely wasn’t hungry. Granted, I basically almost ate two lunches, but I didn’t find myself missing meat</p>

<p><strong>Could I go Vegan?</strong></p>

<p>If I had a vegan friend group, or a vegan significant other, definitely. But I am unfortunately a person who caves to social pressure and I really, really love eating non-vegan deep dish pizza with J.</p>

<p><strong>What will I keep from Veganism?</strong></p>

<p>That breakfast was amazing and I can’t believe it took me this long to make. Also, I’d be more willing to grab a vegan entree at work.</p>

<p>Are you vegan? Could you do vegan? What good vegan eats did I miss out on?</p>
