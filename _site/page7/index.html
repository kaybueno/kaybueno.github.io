	<h1><a href="/12-22-2014/holiday-cookie-baking.html">Weekend Recap - Family Baking Time</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		December 22, 2014
	</div>

	<p>Greetings from Chicago. I’m finally home for the holidays. </p>

<p>Do you ever have really terrible ideas you don’t realize are terrible until after you’re stuck? Welcome to me, with my flight home. For some reason, I thought it was a great idea to go with the cheapest Southwest one I could find. Which meant on Saturday, I was on a plane from 2:00pm-8:30pm. Total day killer.</p>

<p>I made up for my Saturday’s transgressions by spending time with family. I did some last minute shopping, and came across this train. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-mOyMJNq6oEg/VJeI4In2bkI/AAAAAAAARvM/TGSSp70rkVM/w593-h716-no/IMG_5489.JPG" alt="kay in train"></p>

<p>I wouldn’t have even noticed the train, or sat in it, or even posted about it, if it didn’t have a very very angry sign.</p>

<p>The sign said, and I quote “CHILDREN ONLY IN SEAT. NO CLIMBING OR HANGING. DO NOT DAMAGE. VIDEO MONITORING PRESENT!!!”</p>

<p>Post shopping, all the girls in the family (and my surprisingly-jaunty-after-getting-his-intestines-removed brother.) got together to bake and decorate cookies.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-nTZomQUI-qc/VJhSN1L1XjI/AAAAAAAARw4/CoIs0vbz_EM/w896-h672-no/cookiecollage.png" alt="cookie making"></p>

<p>The women in my family have been baking cookies since I was 4. Each year we end up taking on more and more cookies varieties (fortunately, we keep adding women to the family, by love or by birth). </p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/FbiuN6F-wgkBHZsQPPWa27A9pTzo2xL_wOf69t5pEeET=w586-h716-no" alt="The cookie table"> </p>

<p>Everyone’s cookies represent their individual baking, decorating or eating style. My youngest cousin topped everything in sprinkles, I used a small star point to fill my cookies, and my grandma dipped everything in chocolate. </p>

<p>Notable cookies are the “Pokeball” sugar cookie, and the “I will kill u” star. We’re not murderers here, it’s just that my brother is very allergic to red dye, and so my sister (who has a mean hand with a piping bag) always makes a few sarcastic cookies.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/FzE2HOdWqq9znzkRJhaqvaz7fluACFlrgRbGvHyZgqJ9=w896-h672-no" alt="i will kill u"></p>

<p>After 5 hours of flour, sugar, butter, and love. We finally finished and took a quick photo of the gang. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-5z031tOPR-U/VJePlVNXwLI/AAAAAAAARts/_OmUO5o7uEs/w955-h716-no/IMG_5567.JPG" alt="Candid family photo"></p>

<p>It’s memories like these that you don’t forget. Partially because it’s so much fun, and partially because that red frosting is never coming out of the carpet.</p>

<p>What does your family do for the holidays? Do you have a “signature” cookie?</p>

	<h1><a href="/12-19-2014/washi-tape-tree.html">Christmas Decorations for Apartments - The Washi Tape Tree</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		December 19, 2014
	</div>

	<p>I live in a tiny little studio, I affectionately call the cardboard box. Housing prices are crazy in the Bay Area, so even if you have a relatively good job, you’re basically stuck with a room in an apartment from the late 1800s (beautiful victorians), or a unit in a complex built in the 1950s (ugly concrete/stucco boxes). I have the latter.</p>

<p>This year, our complex manager offered 100 dollars off January’s rent to anyone who decorated their apartment’s exterior. While some of the units have small yards, big windows, and cute entryways, my exterior is basically just a door. Decorating for apartments is hard enough, can&#39;t paint, can&#39;t leave a mark, no giant tear down DIY projects. So here’s how I made it work. (Because let’s be real, I am motivated by money!)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-CP0iEL7rgA4/VJRlTKNfWUI/AAAAAAAARbk/vESJfjF88do/w915-h1256-no/IMG_5464.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>This is my washi tape tree door. I don’t have any electrical outlets around my building, so I couldn’t really do a beautiful light display. And I’m shelling out for gifts right now, so I didn’t want to drop a ton of cash on decorations. The solution? Washi tape.</p>

<p>Washi tape is thin, colored, plastic-y tape that originated in Japan. It’s kind of like, thin plastic painter’s tape, or masking tape. It definitely doesn’t have the holding power of like, duct tape, but it comes in the most beautiful array of colors and patterns. And best of all, scotch is carrying it now, so I found a bunch of them at target, and staples.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-2kDRd_AgUZc/VJRlWp7S14I/AAAAAAAARbs/-S-1YQkNx8s/w915-h686-no/IMG_5467.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>I had seen a lot of small, desk decoration type, washi tape trees on the internet. And decided to do it on a bigger scale. I basically freehanded the tree, and then added the decorations. </p>

<p>Before the mini ball ornaments, I tried a tree with tinsel. While I loved the tinsel texture, the weight of the garland made it so I had to constantly add more tape to it. And the abstract and messy nature of tinsel took away from the tree shape.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/NXVEprJ1XeHMONXGU9TLR9bzAA2jwavX1NKwCDaRB34S=w915-h1083-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Washi tape’s major benefit to me, is that it doesn’t (or hasn’t) damaged my door in any way. I removed the garland with no sticky residue, and no paint pulled up. It’s a fun way to decorate, or let kids decorate the walls, door, etc, without having to worry about damage.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-eC8RF79_6YA/VJRlVr62qaI/AAAAAAAARb0/ariC5Dm-StM/w915-h694-no/IMG_5466.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>All in all, it was an incredibly cheap option. Less than 15 dollars. I spent ~3 dollars per roll of tape, ~50 cents for the bows, and ~4 dollars for a bag of mini ornaments. (To be fair, I had the cord from another project, so the string didn’t cost me any money.) And even better, I’ve finally met my neighbors because people keep stopping by to ask me about it. (Probably because they too want the 100 dollar credit, but I’ll blame it on my art skills.)</p>

<p>How are you decorating this year? Have you used washi tape before?</p>

	<h1><a href="/12-17-2014/WIAW.html">WIAW, Holiday Photos Edition</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		December 17, 2014
	</div>

	<p>Indulge me for a minute, before I get to my normal daily eats. I want to share some of the pictures that came back from the holiday parties we went to last weekend. When I was going through the album for the entire party, it’s all cute couples pictures, standing together, hugging, kissing, and then you get to me and J.</p>

<p>J is one of the coolest guys ever (in my book), because while I’m only showing you two of the shots we got back, there are 10, and he worked it in every single one. I love a man who will strike ridiculous poses with me.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-YNxIk8JWTNU/VJB_PTQnwhI/AAAAAAAARM4/d1oQAUSVPqQ/w915-h610-no/kittholidayparty6.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-hLkDaErBrO8/VJB_QthNzOI/AAAAAAAARM8/BC2a2PDzFk4/w915-h610-no/kittholidayparty8.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Okay, back to the eats!</p>

<p>I obviously had a little bit of a sweet tooth today. So enjoy what happens when craving attack. <a href="http://peasandcrayons.com/2014/12/wiaw-204.html">What I ate Wednesday</a> style.</p>

<p>If you’ve followed along, you know that my breakfast is usually bagged eggs and fruit. (Sexy, I know). But, I switched it up a bit this morning with steel cut oats, topped with cinnamon, ground flax, cranberries, raisins, toasted coconut and a little nugget or two of brown sugar. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/hJ9dLEWW67Y5OVrfOYXAGOpfsqKki5mC0JAg2dDm4656=w915-h984-no" alt=""></p>

<p>My lunch has been salad focused. So here is a big salad with miso dressing along with a few slices of tuna maki. I didn’t eat the matcha rice pictured, I don’t have anything against eating it, except I don’t really enjoy the texture of rice unless it’s masked by something much more delicious, like raw tuna.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-UeZGcLDiQQo/VIC5oWGyzCI/AAAAAAAAQIQ/uGlZ4aJBomQ/w914-h541-no/IMG_5027.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Post lunch, team froyo. It’s hard to tell, but this is actually vanilla yogurt, mixed with a chocolate banana (made with actual banana) “soft serve”. I then topped it with sprinkles and white chocolate shavings. My sister has told me before that serving it in this tiny cup is an embarrassment of ice cream. I sort of agree.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/mNuaGgKPmxGVTFfCgW9HTK0JXlrNo85SGTCC6sCh5wwo=w915-h882-no" alt=""></p>

<p>A sneaky selfie of me and an “Apple Pear”. Whatever these fruit are, they’re in season, I’ve probably had one daily. I’ve had to get a bowl to catch the serious amount of juice in this fruit.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/roI7cTmT6un63AgbuIgJbe9k9vMmkNC4lnMv6Jd9UbpK=w915-h1075-no" alt=""></p>

<p>This is a shot cup of a bunch of chocolate covered almonds. Delicious. I probably need to cut these out of my daily eats. They’re so delicious, but I think every time I go grab a cup, another almond sneaks it’s way in. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-xpbgRcVJ3Cq2xZLWCj8y5xpb05iTT1do6rROEp7t6CF=s915-no" alt=""></p>

<p>I also ate an orange, later that night. But I’ll admit this was a pretty protein free, sugar filled day.</p>

<p>I’m inclined to fix that stuff up after the New Year, but honestly, if this is my average day moving through the holidays. I’m pretty thrilled. My biggest goals over the next three weeks are to move a bunch, and to not eat an entire tray of cookies unless it’s worth it. :)</p>

<p>What do you crave? Do you have a signature pose for photobooths? I swear when they count down, I never know how to pose!</p>

	<h1><a href="/12-16-2014/sevenly-cause-box.html">Sevenly CauseBox Review where I tell you how much I loved it.</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		December 16, 2014
	</div>

	<p>I’ll admit, I kind of love subscription boxes. It seems backwards, not knowing what you’re getting when you pay for it. But, as an adult buying boring things like ziploc bags, and dishwasher liquid, sometimes, online shopping gets boring. So subscription boxes are the closest thing I can get to buying myself presents.</p>

<p>I’ve been loving <a href="sevenly.org">Sevenly</a> forever. They have the softest, most flattering shirts ever and they let me feel as if I’m helping people at the same time.</p>

<p>So when they launched a quarterly box of products that benefit good causes, not gonna lie I bought a year of it. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/VVMY7o2A5N-yFKHjazvYSSIjA8MFgEhWgf51wHmcrHY0=w1036-h716-no" alt="The box"></p>

<p>I got the box at work today, and it was a little beat up. But I&#39;m not one to judge a book by it&#39;s cover (at least when it comes to boxes I really really want to open), I am one however to take photos on a black background with a white blog. Ooops!</p>

<p>The first thing I got out of the box was a super cute pack of Thank You notes. They&#39;re printed in LA and gorgeous photos. But the best part is that it comes with a wax seal. If you get a random thank you in the next year, it&#39;s because all I want to do now is press wax letter seals now.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the unopened package.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/hsS7v61BGcSdmTxhFBqYapWJeVg9wBJ4bObuKppoQvcl=s716-no" alt="First package of thank you notes"></p>

<p>The four cards. They&#39;re post card format, I can&#39;t wait to send them. Although, I&#39;m not sure if anyone&#39;s thankful for cold weather scenes.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-3KAsUrBfwcE/VI-8cyvixNI/AAAAAAAARG4/_NmWDkJURqY/s716-no/IMG_5364.JPG" alt="Cards and the stamp"></p>

<p>And here&#39;s the stamp and wax up close. I love that the stamp says &quot;thx&quot;. But now I&#39;m going to want one for all my letters, not just my thank you cards. I&#39;ll have to find one with a heart, or a star, or my name, which might be a little self inflated.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/gZeM2EEF4SN4NdiwZiDgZHxCXHXpJNXYgFum1lcyzMSq=w895-h716-no" alt="Stamp pattern and envelope"></p>

<p>The next part of the box was the Sevenly Change for Change jar. One of J and my&#39;s ultimate first world problems is that J hates having change in his pockets, wallet, car, etc. So I dump all the change in my purse. Last time I emptied my purse I had 17 dollars in coins in it. Now I have somewhere more reasonable to drop my change than empty candle jars. And I&#39;ll feel guilted into donating it. :)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-2CZlFZZi980/VI-8xCzounI/AAAAAAAARGA/dupxsBcYgGo/w800-h716-no/IMG_5381.JPG" alt="Cutest change jar"></p>

<p>An adorable handwoven scarf. I need more solid, plain scarves. When all your scarves have birds, or chains, or prints on them, they get harder to wear with other things. :) Love this one.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-xK0M_5B_f1s/VI-86R72lGI/AAAAAAAARGY/nddDfTPheWc/w799-h716-no/IMG_5397.JPG" alt="Scarf"></p>

<p>My favorite piece was a little tiny elephant necklace. I&#39;ve been wearing it already, it&#39;s the perfect length, and it sits super flat on my neck, which is so amazing. But. Elephants are my favorite animals ever. So this was basically made for me.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/PbeCMcJT32U7954ur7V2-OrWKw2qrm6kcgN45HEBnUsJ=w679-h716-no" alt="A little tiny elephant necklace"></p>

<p>A tiny purse I&#39;m going to use as a makeup bag for flights and traveling in between J and my places. It&#39;s much much prettier than it looks in the photos. And it&#39;s the perfect size for travel.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/dGh61TRQd-LR_M9-dH66pC2gtUMyNLJmcVKr-kzpZG88=w933-h716-no" alt="Little baby purse"></p>

<p>And last but not least, the snacks! Delicious little cacao nibs, and a glorified granola bar. They&#39;re both gluten free, and the nibs are delicious. The bar I&#39;m saving for my flight home for the holidays.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-fdt4YHAxw_I/VI-8sSU5NYI/AAAAAAAARF4/XnvxwSxofkw/w619-h716-no/IMG_5377.JPG" alt="Snacks"></p>

<p>Overall, this is one of the few boxes where I actually felt like the amount I paid was pretty well reflected in the final product. I&#39;ve seen a lot of make-up/beauty subscription boxes and while I love the idea, I just don&#39;t need another lip gloss, or face moisturizer. So the items in those boxes often end up being not worth the product for me. But I actually plan on using all the items in this one. Sorry friends, I won&#39;t be regifting. :)</p>

<p>I bought this myself, but Sevenly is cool. I just happened to really like it, and I love finding new subscription boxes, so I figured I&#39;d share it with you. :)</p>

<p>Do you subscribe to any subscriptions? (I also love <a href="http://www.footcardigan.com/">Foot Cardigan</a> and <a href="https://www.stitchfix.com/">Stitch Fix</a>) What&#39;s the best gift you&#39;ve gotten yourself?</p>
