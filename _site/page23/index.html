	<h1><a href="/7-4-2014/fireworks.html">Fourth of July the Works</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		July 4, 2014
	</div>

	<p>I’m not a firework person. I’m not an America the beautiful person. I don’t get most rah-rah holidays to begin with. But I went to the local fireworks with family, and I took some cool pictures and have to share.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-1C8ZLrBs_Q4/U-K5azQXM8I/AAAAAAAAF04/_upJ65ewzsg/w537-h716-no/IMG_2259.JPG" alt="‘The works’"></p>

<p>Even though people camped out at the venue all day to get good seats. We arrived like 30 minutes before show time, and snagged great digs right where a funnel cake vendor was closing. (Note to friends, and hey, even enemies. Don’t watch how your funnel cakes are made. I would quicker eat mixed concrete.)</p>

<p>The show was set to music, which was actually pretty awesome, and they timed the explosions to hit key points in the songs. There were even little heart fireworks for a song about love. Unfortunately most were upside down, but it’s the thought that counts.</p>

<p>Despite taking about 120 fireworks pictures with my iPhone, none contain the heart. Cool story.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-tMmF3a6y9a4/U-K3D1BrSAI/AAAAAAAAFjo/hKx8pK1y-lY/w537-h716-no/IMG_2167.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>All together, it was actually pretty cool. Even if it meant I had to listen to Katy Perry’s firework song like 20 times. I was a huge nerd and took a bunch of pictures, filmed the entire finale, and said “oh my god” way too many times. </p>

<p>Who knows, maybe I’ll come around on the Fourth of July. Might be my favorite holiday next year.</p>

	<h1><a href="/6-21-2014/berry-picking.html">Berries in the Bay</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		June 21, 2014
	</div>

	<p>When I was little, my family used to go apple picking every fall. We’d ride the hay ride, pick more apples than we would ever eat, and buy a dozen apple donuts. I now realize this tradition was more for getting to binge on apple donuts than a love of picking apples.</p>

<p>This last weekend, J and I went to go relive my childhood by picking Olallieberries (a cross between a bunch of berries, most notably the blackberry) from a small farm down highway 1.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-QPtW6iX8xO0/U-K1s5_qJiI/AAAAAAAAFZA/wTdZn39DjvI/w955-h716-no/IMG_2094.JPG" alt="Kay picks berries yo"></p>

<p>We were (are?) like children. (And of course, we were the only people there without children, go figure.) We ran around trying to pick all the “best” berries. J kept telling me we had enough, we had too many berries, we would never eat this many. And I was pretty sure I could finish all of the berries in the car ride home. (Spoiler alert: I did not eat all the berries on the way home.) </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-OIZ9vwBLmzs/U-KwwXP8vyI/AAAAAAAAFWI/a3nQdR0jkzA/w955-h716-no/IMG_2082.JPG" alt="Serious berry haul"></p>

<p>After our serious berry haul, we made our way to Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park. A mouthful of a name, if you ask me. We started aimlessly walking around because we couldn’t find a map, and then ran into an ultra marathon trail run group, who were on their 35th mile. I then felt a little guilty about my long runs being 6 miles.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/CBgpwsm27tnbWLWhgB8PO8XYpIv5oOCh9jBQLqHBGXc=w578-h716-no" alt="But for real, it’s beautiful"></p>

<p>Since we had no destination, we eventually hit a river that cut off our path. The ultramarathoners were unreal amazing and just ran through the waist deep water like it was nothing. However. I was unprepared, so J and I scrambled across the rocks to get to the other side. Success! Our shoes only got a little wet, and I didn’t fall in. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-dyp46wIbqfo/U-K2YQrQBzI/AAAAAAAAFeQ/f4SlRyv4ukI/w537-h716-no/IMG_2122.JPG" alt="This is a river"></p>

<p>Ultimately, after crossing the river, we came upon a bunch of dead animals in the woods, and that seemed like a good sign to turn around, so we did. We hopped back in the car, drove home, and ate all the rest of the berries.</p>

<p>Should have picked more.</p>

	<h1><a href="/6-9-2014/lazy-bear.html">Lazy Bear, the ultimate eating experience</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		June 9, 2014
	</div>

	<p>Ever find something decidedly cool, from an incredibly uncool place? J and I found out about Lazy Bear, an underground dinner you sign up for lottery style a few months ago. After months of putting our names in, we finally were chosen for this many many course experience. We thought we were cool, and hip, and maybe read it in the New York Times, or heard it from a food loving friend. </p>

<p>But no. It was Yelp. The number one rated “restaurant” in SF. Not so cool. The courses were all amazing, and there are so many, that I won’t describe every one in detail.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-GC2xJUp4KII/U-Ku5cqjisI/AAAAAAAAFMQ/6BxIMi2tENM/w537-h716-no/IMG_2021.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Let’s begin. I missed snapping photos of some of the initial courses, so, this is not representative of the full meal.</p>

	<h1><a href="/5-13-2014/moms-day-in-e-bay.html">Ziplining is for adults too!</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		May 13, 2014
	</div>

	<p>Our second day in Lake Tahoe, we didn’t want to kill ourselves with another hike, especially since we were snowed on the day before. Buuuuut, we both wanted to see balancing rock before we left.</p>

<p>We considered a few activities, kayaking, paddle boarding, zip lining, all the watersports were closed until Memorial Day. I really, really didn’t want to zipline. I thought it’d be super boring, since we did it in Costa Rica. But I caved in, and let J book it. We ended up getting a two for one deal though, and hell, I like coupons. :)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-MF3Q5JJ772c/U3G58nAFtFI/AAAAAAAABAA/wM2F13TCXSY/w1059-h706-no/kitt-glamour-rock.jpg" alt="!"></p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-p2Wu5OSegmM/U3G5t6LhPFI/AAAAAAAAA-0/L9mBHjTelr8/w1059-h706-no/dino-rock.jpg" alt="!"></p>

<p>J’s knees hurt, and it didn’t look like the gate to balancing rock was open. So we parked in a little outlet nearby. OMG. Best decision ever. It was like less than half a mile to the site. We ran around and took pictures. Since the rock entrance was closed, we were the only people there. Which made for a quiet morning.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-U05o7E1MZaQ/U3G59ZWoQ7I/AAAAAAAABAE/mtXwFnpk--0/w1059-h706-no/kitt-holding-rock.jpg" alt="!"></p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-I-9NhpYICGg/U3G5xy2Zy_I/AAAAAAAAA_I/KNh6gF3reDw/w477-h716-no/jon-climbing-rock.jpg" alt="!"></p>

<p>When you’re at balancing rock though, it almost feels like it could fall on you. It didn’t, but it feeeeels like it could.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-9qpPDSp4cHA/U3G5yQN2ExI/AAAAAAAAA_M/1FmU55iCiUM/w1059-h706-no/jon-holding-rock.jpg" alt="!"></p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-9BQes_JxnJo/U3G6CSF3H2I/AAAAAAAABAs/b1_KVMZ-llU/w477-h716-no/kitt-muscle.jpg" alt="!"></p>

<p>Speaking of things falling, I’m the clumsiest person ever. I totally bit it and fell hard on my hands and knees walking back to the car. At the time, it didn’t seem like a big deal, you know? I just fell. I’m an adult. I should be able to handle it. But as we got on the road, I realized that I was bleeding through my yoga pants. We picked up some bandaids and alcohol wipes and cleaned up before getting to the high ropes course.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-i3orpttFHkk/U3WlqtTCPYI/AAAAAAAABDs/x5iwFnu546A/w504-h672-no/2014-05-11+13.42.47.jpg" alt="!"></p>

<p>Dude. It was insane.</p>

<p>Let me first point out that we were the only childless adults at the facility. But once we got past that, it was so cool. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-F_vh07mAtTA/U3WlrlNLctI/AAAAAAAABDU/fxL5zrvrpx4/s672-no/2014-05-11+15.11.44.jpg" alt="!"></p>

<p>Basically, they rigged up 5 different levels of treetop courses. They all involved some level of balancing, climbing, jumping, and zip lining. You would clip in and climb up a ladder, onto a platform, have to tightrope across to the next platform, and then skateboard in mid-air into a weirdly woven web that you climb across to a zipline. And repeat with a billion different challenges.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-vfE1FnLv0nI/U3WlqBLu4UI/AAAAAAAABDE/arS7FNkUljk/s672-no/2014-05-11+14.32.30+HDR.jpg" alt="!"></p>

<p>We did every single one of them. It was crazy fun. This was also the Sunday of Mother’s Day, so there were a lot of moms there. I felt really bad at some points because a lot of the moms, despite being in decent to good shape, were really afraid of failing at the courses, so they didn’t even try.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-2V7j8TJf0EM/U3WlrE5onqI/AAAAAAAABD4/awH9-tJZTIY/w896-h672-no/2014-05-11+13.56.19.jpg" alt="!"></p>

<p>To be fair though, it was hard. The next day I was so sore, I wanted to puke.</p>
