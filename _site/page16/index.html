	<p>After a hot sweaty hike the day before. We opted to get out of the heat, and hide in the caverns of Lake Shasta, where temperatures are much much cooler. Getting to the caverns was pretty low activity, you bought a ticket, walked down to the dock, got on a boat, went across the lake, and then were bussed to the cavern. Despite being sedentary, the views were amaaazing.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-LhdmCPXMdnA/U-K-11IrUuI/AAAAAAAAGTk/lww3P8YEOVI/w955-h716-no/IMG_2480.JPG" alt="Views of Lake Shasta"></p>

<p>Inside the cavern was really amazing (granted, I haven’t really been in many caves). The guide was well rehearsed, and went by a kind of cheesy script that kept the children, and the adults with no attention span paying attention, and away from touching all the rocks. (Which is bad.)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-EzpepRdzDsY/U-K_MHPAXiI/AAAAAAAAGWY/ZBI-ZV7F0II/w537-h716-no/IMG_2497.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Since people online make a big deal of it, we were hoping the cave might be strenuous. But it’s really mostly sight seeing. We were told it was 80 stories of stairs, but in reality, it’s 80 steps, or 8 stories, and when moving in a group, you basically take this at a snails pace.</p>

<p>The whole cave is pretty amazing, but the best part is the end, with this crazy kind of cathedral formation at the end. This was the only time the guide really paused, and so we were able to convince him to snap a quick picture.</p>

	<p>This summer our vacations have been beautifully formulaic. We choose a place a few hours out from San Francisco. Book a shitty motel in the area. Then hike, bike, and eat the local food.</p>

<p>Since day one in SF, J has been wanting to go to Shasta. So bam! We did. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-5IiGWdT2Upg/U-K9vta2UkI/AAAAAAAAGOQ/DAkb-vXkHRE/w537-h716-no/IMG_2442.JPG" alt="We made it!"></p>

<p>Because we are nowhere near cool enough, we decided not to actually hike Shasta itself. Mostly since we wanted to spend our time just looking at it. And also because, it takes like a whole day, and it was 108 degrees outside. So hot.</p>

<p>We ended up at Castle Crags, a pretty sweet hike. We started from a parking area, and climbed. Since we believed the things we read on the internet, we hear this was going to be a 5 mile hike, total. Unfortunately, since we never looked at a map, we didn’t realize that it was 5 miles to the top, and 5 back down. Oops.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Ec8vG2XtRLxBrsHopGNMB6vn09VLzOxqTkPV25TtZ5I=w1062-h682-no" alt=""></p>

<p>The hike had about 2000 ft elevation gain over a 5 mile windy path. And then the last 500 feet was a lot of scrambling up rocks. Which I pretty much hate the most ever. I always feel, regardless of how much actual safety there is, that I’m going to fall down. So after a few minutes of scrambling, I told J to go ahead, and I’d wait. I was tired, it was hot, we were running out of water. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Y8PdFkfn1xo/U-K9gaSGoaI/AAAAAAAAGMw/aAIbmjvNGvE/w403-h716-no/IMG_2431.JPG" alt="J summits crags. Balla’."></p>

<p>He made it to the top, it was amazing and beautiful, and I’m still glad I didn’t go.</p>

<p>Fortunately, on the way down, we stopped at this small, .2 mile hike to Indian Springs. Where there was potable water! I have never been so happy in the world ever for potable water. It was beautiful and amazing, and the best thing ever. We drank a lot of spring water, and then ran down the mountain for 5 miles. </p>

<p>I took a shower that flooded the entire bathroom. But I must say, a crappy motel bed and threadbare blankets never felt so good.</p>

	<p>I’m not a firework person. I’m not an America the beautiful person. I don’t get most rah-rah holidays to begin with. But I went to the local fireworks with family, and I took some cool pictures and have to share.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-1C8ZLrBs_Q4/U-K5azQXM8I/AAAAAAAAF04/_upJ65ewzsg/w537-h716-no/IMG_2259.JPG" alt="‘The works’"></p>

<p>Even though people camped out at the venue all day to get good seats. We arrived like 30 minutes before show time, and snagged great digs right where a funnel cake vendor was closing. (Note to friends, and hey, even enemies. Don’t watch how your funnel cakes are made. I would quicker eat mixed concrete.)</p>

<p>The show was set to music, which was actually pretty awesome, and they timed the explosions to hit key points in the songs. There were even little heart fireworks for a song about love. Unfortunately most were upside down, but it’s the thought that counts.</p>

<p>Despite taking about 120 fireworks pictures with my iPhone, none contain the heart. Cool story.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-tMmF3a6y9a4/U-K3D1BrSAI/AAAAAAAAFjo/hKx8pK1y-lY/w537-h716-no/IMG_2167.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>All together, it was actually pretty cool. Even if it meant I had to listen to Katy Perry’s firework song like 20 times. I was a huge nerd and took a bunch of pictures, filmed the entire finale, and said “oh my god” way too many times. </p>

<p>Who knows, maybe I’ll come around on the Fourth of July. Might be my favorite holiday next year.</p>

	<p>When I was little, my family used to go apple picking every fall. We’d ride the hay ride, pick more apples than we would ever eat, and buy a dozen apple donuts. I now realize this tradition was more for getting to binge on apple donuts than a love of picking apples.</p>

<p>This last weekend, J and I went to go relive my childhood by picking Olallieberries (a cross between a bunch of berries, most notably the blackberry) from a small farm down highway 1.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-QPtW6iX8xO0/U-K1s5_qJiI/AAAAAAAAFZA/wTdZn39DjvI/w955-h716-no/IMG_2094.JPG" alt="Kay picks berries yo"></p>

<p>We were (are?) like children. (And of course, we were the only people there without children, go figure.) We ran around trying to pick all the “best” berries. J kept telling me we had enough, we had too many berries, we would never eat this many. And I was pretty sure I could finish all of the berries in the car ride home. (Spoiler alert: I did not eat all the berries on the way home.) </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-OIZ9vwBLmzs/U-KwwXP8vyI/AAAAAAAAFWI/a3nQdR0jkzA/w955-h716-no/IMG_2082.JPG" alt="Serious berry haul"></p>

<p>After our serious berry haul, we made our way to Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park. A mouthful of a name, if you ask me. We started aimlessly walking around because we couldn’t find a map, and then ran into an ultra marathon trail run group, who were on their 35th mile. I then felt a little guilty about my long runs being 6 miles.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/CBgpwsm27tnbWLWhgB8PO8XYpIv5oOCh9jBQLqHBGXc=w578-h716-no" alt="But for real, it’s beautiful"></p>

<p>Since we had no destination, we eventually hit a river that cut off our path. The ultramarathoners were unreal amazing and just ran through the waist deep water like it was nothing. However. I was unprepared, so J and I scrambled across the rocks to get to the other side. Success! Our shoes only got a little wet, and I didn’t fall in. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-dyp46wIbqfo/U-K2YQrQBzI/AAAAAAAAFeQ/f4SlRyv4ukI/w537-h716-no/IMG_2122.JPG" alt="This is a river"></p>

<p>Ultimately, after crossing the river, we came upon a bunch of dead animals in the woods, and that seemed like a good sign to turn around, so we did. We hopped back in the car, drove home, and ate all the rest of the berries.</p>

<p>Should have picked more.</p>
