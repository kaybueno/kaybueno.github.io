	<p>No real update today babes. I had one of those days at work where you’re cranking things out so hard that you don’t realize you’ve been there ten hours. </p>

<p>The weekend is going to be a straight up blast though. Women’s Health 10k, on Sunday, and Bridge School Benefit too. </p>

<p>The only adorable part of my day came in the form of lunch. Work was celebrating breast cancer awareness. So they did a beet paper (pink) wrapped sushi roll. With a salad, and some indian inspired cabbage dish, they were a pretty fantastic lunch.</p>

<p>How was your weekend shaping up? Any major plans?</p>

	<h1><a href="/10-23-2014/motivation.html">What’s your motivation?</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		October 23, 2014
	</div>

	<p>At 5:30 pm, after a 9 hour day of standing (I have a lovely standing desk), looking at a computer screen, and typing, the last thing I want to do is go run, or exercise in general.</p>

<p>And then my brain starts telling me. “Oh, you don’t need to run. You have… work. You’re… tired. You could… spend this time better.” And it takes a lot of work, some will power and a few tricks to get myself here:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/3f1JmkMPH6r8vXm5xiiDYymZwE3rDdIYEdxI9f6XLKg=w955-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>(Seriously this is one of the few times I cared enough in the morning to put on matching socks. Usually I have like, one lime sock and one purple one.)</p>

<p>I’ve been working on a few tricks to get myself to keep ignoring the lazy person inside of me:</p>

<h2>1. Buy myself things for doing exercise</h2>

<p>Childish perhaps. And consumeristic, but very effective. Usually, I set some sort of goal, like: “Exercise 5 days this week”. This week (given I work out tomorrow) I’m buying </p>

<p><a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/167820434/day-of-the-dead-boston-terrier-sugar"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-piTRIVkYqxQ/VEm-JxvgxFI/AAAAAAAAMVw/FLjZze7szn0/w570-h544-no/diadelosdog.jpg" alt=""></a></p>

<h2>2. Keep everything I need to workout at my desk</h2>

<p>Everyone in my building has a little file cabinet. And while most people keep extra work supplies in them (one of my coworkers keeps his full of listerine), I keep a bunch of shirts, a spare pair of tennis shoes, socks and hairbands in them. So I can always get from work appropriate to workout appropriate.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-KEi93M6r840/U-KsUJ8tcrI/AAAAAAAAE2k/H9NScVWwhrc/w537-h716-no/IMG_1863.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>(Things I wouldn’t mind putting in my file cabinet. If I had more money, and I trekked up the the Nike store more often.)</p>

<h2>3. Brag</h2>

<p>No one likes the self righteous exerciser. But I have a few key friends who put up with my boasting because they know if I keep up on staying fit, I’m a more sane person. And I’m always open to them when they want to hit me up about their latest sweat sesh.</p>

<p>Even with all of this, sometimes fitness still falls by the wayside. What’s your trick to keeping motivated?</p>

	<h1><a href="/10-22-2014/WIAW.html">What I ate Wednesday</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		October 22, 2014
	</div>

	<p>I have to say, while I usually don’t love looking at my own mediocre pictures of food that I secretly take while (I hope) my coworkers aren’t looking. I get some perverse joy out of seeing what other people are eating, and so in that, I have to indulge you in my Wednesday food lineup. If you too love looking at what others are eating check out <a href="http://peasandcrayons.com/">more here</a>.</p>

<p>This is food no filter. So what I ate, I snapped. Basically, all my meals are provided by my workplace. So I’m a little constrained with what I eat.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/TJJMFn1QlUzjpfCuBH3DXkXqBDnOY3uJ0lLhYfVIBFA=w890-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Breakfast is usually fruit + eggs or cottage cheese. (Plus a giant coffee, black). This is just the most simple meal that will tide me over until lunch. I have this basically every day but Friday. :)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-MfHRSq3-7l4/VEgCW9NYkEI/AAAAAAAAMSE/H7LNXJd4D2A/w955-h716-no/IMG_4034.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>We had a food truck here today that served salads!</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-aSb6075UWVw/VEgCeFI6DhI/AAAAAAAAMTA/pe7EZep8nlY/w955-h716-no/IMG_4039.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Tuna poke salad with carrots, cucumbers, brown rice and a miso dressing. Super delicious but, way too much rice. My bowl looked like this at the end of lunch:</p>

<p>I’m a person who lives off of snacks. So in the afternoon, I had a little of:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-pU8tj7pG63c/VEfmprnQHvI/AAAAAAAAMUQ/0ZaKsmMxD3w/w604-h716-no/IMG_4028.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>And some of</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/XgrbgZ6rEWWi411MZwXCIOK0VHmQmccHA2lUm-TxMfQ=w537-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>I’m not much of a dinner person, so taking one from Oliva Pope, I’ll be having a bowl of popcorn, but no wine. I’d snap a picture, but I haven’t eaten it yet.</p>

<p>Over all, I’d probably like to add some more vegetables to my day, and maybe a little protein. I’m hoping to pick up some Quest bars on the suggestion of a friend, because while my body handles sugar substitutes pretty well, I become a maniac on sugar. Maybe next Wednesday I’ll throw in a real salad. :)</p>

<p>In true form, I can’t end this post without this awesome and hilariously flattering selfie I took and then applied a million filters to this morning. My toggling with weird image settings game is getting so strong.</p>

<p>I know pumpkin is like the it food of the month. I obviously need to work on my pumpkin game. Have you been indulging in any fall favorites?</p>

	<h1><a href="/10-21-2014/improving-seawheeze.html">How I’m improving for Seawheeze 2015.</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		October 21, 2014
	</div>

	<p>Seawheeze 2014 was one of the best experiences of my life. It was my first half marathon. I was able to travel to Vancouver to do a beautiful run. I was so in love with it, I signed up only a month after finishing, just to run it again this year.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-eLhyEkexHl0/U-KbONyZxWI/AAAAAAAADgI/g644W8tVHFk/s716-no/IMG_1567.JPG" alt="Run selfie"></p>

<p>That said, it was my first half, and there are a lot of things I’d like to improve on the next time.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Run other races. Seawheeze was my first half marathon, but it was also my first real race. I didn’t start running until 14 weeks before the race, and unfortunately, I couldn’t even fit a real, organized 5k in before it. But this year, I’m running a bunch of different races. I figure, it’s good to figure out how the whole race circus works before you run 13 miles of one.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/--IGr8r8VJnA/U-Ki8-ohixI/AAAAAAAAEM4/j4mgzjUiJ6k/w640-h617-no/IMG_1591.PNG" alt=""></p></li>
<li><p>Train early. While I’m perversely proud that I went from couch to half marathon in a little under 4 months, I think it’s a pretty crazy goal if you aren’t incredibly devoted. I’m excited to have time to improve upon my runs, not just knock out specific mileage in hopes of hitting 13 of them by a certain date.</p></li>
<li><p>Cross train. The app strongly suggests yoga and cross training alongside the running. As a naive, but busy person. I figured. I’m running a race, I just need the running part. So I skipped all the suggested yoga, and cross training, and just ran. This caused a lot of unnecessary tightness, and pain, and if I was more of an idiot, potential injury.  </p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-S3xLpftBP7M/VEWLBo8yDbI/AAAAAAAAMN4/IZrL6rrVwhk/w403-h715-no/IMG_4018.PNG" alt=""></p></li>
<li><p>Train outdoors more. I love, and will make every argument for treadmill running. I can set a pace, turn off my brain, watch bad reality tv on my phone, and put a giant fan on myself since I sweat more than anyone I know. But! If you’re going to run outside, you might want to do some outside runs. I’m hoping to fit more in, or find someone to run with in the park. (And yes, I do photograph my silly treadmill runs.)</p></li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-TtsJz_VVYeM/U-KwtL-q_oI/AAAAAAAAMOU/Guj6MM381Fk/w1038-h658-no/IMG_2079.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Even with my newbie mistakes, signing up to run a half marathon on a whim was one of the best things I could have ever done. I’m just hoping to document my gaffes so I don’t let it happen twice. :)</p>

<p>Any half marathon, or just running tips you learned the hard way?</p>
