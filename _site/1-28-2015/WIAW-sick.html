	<h1><a href="">What I ate Wednesday, when I was sick.</a></h1>

	<p>I had a beautiful WIAW planned that was supposed to feature ingredients and plates that looked something like the picture above.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, when I woke up, I felt miserable. I could barely taste anything (such a waste), and my throat was scratchy and sore. And all my beautiful plans of nuts and other healthy fats were lost to ideas of soup and frozen drinks.</p>

<p>Being sick is hard enough, but trying to make decent food choices when you feel like your throat is made of sandpaper is quite the struggle. Between approximately 285 cups of tea, and a few shots of DayQuil, here’s <a href="//www.peasandcrayons.com">WIAW</a>.</p>

<p>I started the morning with a mango, orange, banana smoothie, and a bowl of apple cinnamon teff cereal. Having never had teff as a breakfast item, it&#39;s pretty close in taste to cream of wheat, or oatmeal. Its texture is much finer, almost like chia, or maybe even as fine as sand.</p>

<p>During lunch I made a break for the soup bar, after filling a bowl, I grabbed a plate of salad, sushi, and quinoa. Since you can&#39;t get Mom&#39;s chicken and dumpling (or noodle if you&#39;re a purist) when you&#39;re 2000 miles away, miso soup and some greens is about as good as it gets.</p>

<p>For snacks I headed to the juice bar, and grabbed a ginger and greens juice and some blueberry oatmeal bites. The bites didn’t really taste like much, but that may have been because I’m sick, or because the juice killed my pallette with a ginger bomb. I&#39;m kind of infatuated with my juice bar, the employees are always cheery, and mix the best drinks. I give them my ailment (DOMS, illness, 3pm fog), and they find me a juice. </p>

<p>At the end of the night I grabbed Ramen with some friends. Hands down the best meal of the day. The spicyness made me forget I ever had sinuses, and the bowl came out so hot that it was basically a noodle sauna.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve got to tell you, I&#39;m so over being sick. When I was a kid, I remember having a light cold as being kind of fun. You got to stay home from school, watch TV, read, chill. Now, having a head cold just means I have to focus more to get my everything at work done, and I feel like I&#39;m wearing a perpetual nose plug, which makes eating, exercising, and talking so much fun. Sexy. I know.</p>

<p>How do you get over a cold? What&#39;s the best thing to eat when you&#39;re sick? :(</p>
