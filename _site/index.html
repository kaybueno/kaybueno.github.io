	<div class="metadata">

	</div>
	<p>Road to Hana! Road to Hana! Road to Hana! </p>

<p>Not to say it’s name too many times, but Road to Hana is one of my favorite parts about Maui. It’s a great reason to get a jeep, take the top off, and drive a few hours down a long windy road that goes to nowhere. (And buy, and consume a lot of banana bread along the way!)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-s5Kco6FBw5E/VB-oufZyDPI/AAAAAAAALWo/1sIPJvAu2SA/w1062-h708-no/IMG_0856.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>So of course, J and I rented a Jeep (after a lot of begging on my part for a Jeep) and set out early on day 3 to embark on the Road to Hana. It’s a drive that could be done back and forth in one day, but J and I wanted to hike a bunch along the way, and do the Pipiwai trail at the Oheo Gulch. So we decided to spend a night in Hana. </p>

<p>This was almost disastrous, as we planned this trip to Hawaii just the week before we flew here. And little did we know, the original day we planned to do Road to Hana, there was a huge foot race/relay on the route. (We’re talking thousands of people running on a one lane road) Thankfully, when we tried to book a hotel, the receptionist told us we were choosing the worst dates for this. Phew.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/NDWzD7LDKbOi2GbZdMLKyZHHkiFU53FG0DhuS5v_ZmQ=w489-h715-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Road to Hana is a journey, filled with twisty passes and one laned bridges, and J and I didn’t want to go it alone. So we downloaded the Road to Hana GyPSy app on our phones. Though the narrator is a little cheesy, without him, we would have never stumbled across things like rainbow eucalyptus!</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-_ILasbMsR7E/VB-omN9PjoI/AAAAAAAALV4/wa5ecKZL-3c/w477-h716-no/IMG_0804.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-f6Goa6m-3J0/VB-olMsqzqI/AAAAAAAALV0/uOIYvt1i88A/w477-h716-no/IMG_0796.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Which are, in my mind, the prettiest trees I’ve ever seen. (Take that cherry blossoms). We also ended up in Keanae. A quiet town with pretty black rock beaches. One of the great things about this narrated, GPS based tour, is that the narrator gives you five important things to do on the road. So there’s no analysis paralysis of trying to pick the best places to stop along the way.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-EPNa5-3laKc/VB91UcXnVnI/AAAAAAAAKXw/cWRt7PIRZow/w1062-h708-no/IMG_0823.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>At the end of the road, we stopped in Hana. We found a super cute hotel called the Hana Kai Maui (of no relation to the Mana Kai Maui). It was seriously one of the most, clean, modern places we stayed. It felt beachy without having that fake resort feel. And the kitchen was high tech. I wanted to live there forever.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-EDQooL44HU0/VB92YQvF9dI/AAAAAAAAKeA/mzgYupFIDrU/w1062-h708-no/IMG_0873.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Since we were on the east side of the island, I hopped into bed as early as possible so I could wake up and catch the sunrise the next day at 5:30 am. </p>

<p>What’s the last adventure you took?</p>

	<h2><a href="/9-23-2014/bike-haleakala.html">Hawaii Vacation Day 2 - Bike Haleakala</a></h2>
	<div class="metadata">
		Posted September 23, 2014.
		Tags: <a class='tag' href='/tags/Hawaii'>Hawaii</a>, <a class='tag' href='/tags/biking'>biking</a>, <a class='tag' href='/tags/Haleakala'>Haleakala</a>, <a class='tag' href='/tags/Maui'>Maui</a>
	</div>
	<p>On the second day in Hawaii we were up bright and early to do a 23 mile long bike ride down Haleakala, Maui’s volcano. We booked with <a href="http://www.bikemaui.com/">Haleakala Bike Co</a> who I would wholeheartedly recommend. Our trip included a van ride to the top, a tour around the crater, and then a long, unsupervised bike ride down. Did I mention unsupervised? (Read: J and I get bored following big groups)</p>

<p>Our guide Kemo, was a local who had ridden down the volcano’s roads by bike, skateboard, and even shopping cart. He was hilarious and personable (as every guide should be), and he should basically quit his day job because the man took the most amazing pictures of us.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-YLpt07JEWDc/VB-ogI31ggI/AAAAAAAALVU/UYlXgTuC0Mk/w1062-h708-no/IMG_0711.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>We reached the summit (by van, although there were people people biking up the mountain. My legs ached for them) and were able to get out and explore. Kemo took pictures of all the bikers under the sign, and also against the crater view.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Q7dGrbZR34g/VB-odGoPSaI/AAAAAAAALU4/kVjHq8xsJuw/w1062-h708-no/IMG_0697.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>It was nice to stretch our legs, and the tour wasn’t rushed at all. There were a bunch of people starting hikes into the crater, so much so that J and I considered returning to hike in the crater but we never ended up doing so. :(</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-vUqCljSsNTY/VB-ogFnFNKI/AAAAAAAALVM/dmZq7yQr17U/w1062-h708-no/IMG_0719.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Post crater tour, we headed back to where we’d hop on the bikes. You can’t bike down from the crater’s summit, because too many people have died doing it, or liability, or something. So we started a few less-steep miles down the road.</p>

<p>Kemo kept shouting to the back of the van that we were lucky, that days rarely got this clear in Maui. So J &amp; I took about half a million pictures of the landscape. From the higher points on Haleakala, you could see both sides of Maui.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-BKfNwXv49lU/VBbeVvmFWlI/AAAAAAAAIXg/J4PHOk860rQ/w955-h716-no/IMG_3145.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>The bike ride was amazing, but simultaneously a little frightening. Some parts of the route are twisty, steep, and have cars driving right alongside you. The brakes on the bike are incredibly sensitive, and very strong, which can lead to unintentional whiplash, but save you from a more awful fate.</p>

<p>Most people were pretty inexperienced at biking, but all turned out fine. Honestly, we did watch one of the other members of our group topple over her bike. A mix of nerves, a large tour bus driving alongside her, and a hairpin turn caused it. She was a little scratched up, but mostly embarrassed. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-AzTYoF7PNuw/VB9ztNjylJI/AAAAAAAAKNg/IMPtZoO-4VI/w1062-h708-no/IMG_0738.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Overall, the ride was super chill. (this is definitely not a calorie burner) But since we spent a few hours out in the sun, we came back tired and chilled the whole evening.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-pyq7d7jtB48/VB9zjjf67BI/AAAAAAAAKMU/_P-cs2hSHIc/w1062-h708-no/IMG_0730.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>What&#39;s the longest you&#39;ve biked?</p>

	<p>If you’ve taken a peek at my Instagram. You may have noticed I was in Hawaii last week! Normally, my boyfriend and I are connected to our laptops all day, every day for work. We wanted to get away from the bright screens, and so we took a laptop-free vacation.</p>

<p>J and I left bright and early in the morning, I was super excited and overly awake on the plane while J fell asleep the moment we hit the seats. Fortunately, we scored some great exit row seats so I was able stretch my legs.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/643vSB_GhE9l9C7UJzRK2UDbTw3a-WSxEoEKFIrLSpg=w667-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>The minute the plane landed, we went to grab a bite to eat. We stopped at Da Kitchen to pick up some local cuisine.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bi4cp5quugepcfO5j9NJsKi54VOQfTtzjLFdUAwwoOQ=w587-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Despite my smile, turns out traditional Hawaiian food isn’t really our thing. I got a pork sandwich, and J ordered a giant Loco Moco (not knowing what a loco moco was, and not knowing that he was ordering the biggest one on the menu). Da Kitchen did a great job cooking our meal, but it was a little too much, and too greasy.</p>

<p>To pay for our food sins we decided to start the afternoon off hiking.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-fmMhRvAEhP4/VB-pmA6CsSI/AAAAAAAALbk/BRcUUpVNCAM/w1062-h708-no/bestofwaiheejon.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>We hit the Waihee Ridge trail up around 1pm. Despite everything on the internet telling us this hike would only be good in the morning, or that finding the parking and trailhead was difficult, we had no problem with either. Google Maps saved the day once again.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/3GxWU7p8FWWH9p38yPUtsupnU9ZK6ZQ9-KR-dZDmJ78=w496-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>The ridge trail is basically all uphill, and has a bunch of really beautiful lookout points. Every time I thought we couldn’t gain more altitude, we did! It switches between forested and exposed, and is definitely on the challenging side of trails. J and I loved it. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-VaD2BzeHpAg/VB-oUxW8ZeI/AAAAAAAALUA/d5-22uGLMwg/w1062-h708-no/IMG_0578.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Despite the serious climb, the views are totally worth it, you feel like you’re in the middle of a Jurassic Park set. The clouds, waterfalls, and super lush foliage are unlike anything in Northern California. The only thing I’d change? J and I only brought one water bottle for the both of us. We definitely needed two.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-8REPgwSmKTU/VB-oZbsPnYI/AAAAAAAALUg/21BC88kBKAI/w1062-h708-no/IMG_0654.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>We ended the day at the Mana Kai Maui in Kihei. Due to a little switch up with our room, we ended up upgraded into one of their condos. The condo was totally adequate, nothing to write home about. But the balcony, or lanai as all of Maui (and possibly Hawaii seems to call it), was amazing.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-igiayIil4to/VB9yiRsMDBI/AAAAAAAAKF0/NcEN12L-ihw/w1062-h708-no/IMG_0678.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>With that view, we spent a lot of time on the balcony watching the sunset, the surf, and just chilling. Since the condo came with a kitchen we were sure to grab fruit at the local market. I seriously improved my pineapple cutting skills. I’m a real fruit ninja now.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/74r5CwLOW4-ZWpZckwLXx-mp2OYqSQakj5hFjF7dKDM=w1062-h713-no" alt=""></p>

<p>But we’re home now! I’ll do some entries over the next few days about the rest of our trip. While vacation is nice, I’m excited to be back into routine. Soylent, running, yoga and work.</p>

	<p>I think all I’ve been doing lately is working, sleeping, and signing up for races.</p>

<p>One of the reasons I keep signing up, is to keep myself running. So I want to pad out my races to approximately one a month. I&#39;m almost covered until the end of the year. But it&#39;s a little spotty in some places. I like doing races that (generally) don&#39;t require fundraising, don&#39;t have colors thrown at you, or zombies, or photoshoots, aren&#39;t super religious, and are relatively fun. With that said, here’s what I’ve got so far.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-YpDOnJqE-Fk/VBPgFDi14yI/AAAAAAAAIMA/FtNav66dzZ8/w650-h350-no/Screen%2BShot%2B2014-09-12%2Bat%2B11.04.49%2Bpm.png" alt=""></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://run10feed10.com">Run 10 Feed 10 - October 2014</a></strong></p>

<p>A philanthropic 10k put on by Women’s Health. I’m super excited because I’ll get to run over the Golden Gate Bridge. (I’ve only ever driven under it. Ooops)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-mAseAeTd5H8/VBPgFNSDXII/AAAAAAAAIMI/vfH8SS9S7wA/w650-h580-no/Screen%2BShot%2B2014-09-12%2Bat%2B11.05.21%2Bpm.png" alt=""></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://theuglysweaterrun.com">Ugly Sweater 5k - November 2014</a></strong></p>

<p>My family’s celebrating Thanksgiving with the ugliest 5k of all. I’m super pumped for this 5k. Both to run alongside (and beat) my siblings. But also because I’ve put together the most hideous Christmas apparel of all time!</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ABozaaNUJpw/VBPfI5BY7gI/AAAAAAAAILM/kkfAvpWU7OU/w679-h177-no/Screen%2BShot%2B2014-09-12%2Bat%2B11.06.01%2Bpm.png" alt=""></p>

<p><strong><a href="www.hotchocolate15k.com">Hot Chocolate 15k - January 2015</a></strong></p>

<p>I chose this race because a 15k is like the lazy man’s half. And I’m lazy. And it’s super flat. And there’s chocolate at the end of it. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-PLYtiwGpx90/VBPfJf2VfcI/AAAAAAAAILQ/welfgHWRpFk/w711-h350-no/Screen%2BShot%2B2014-09-12%2Bat%2B11.06.51%2Bpm.png" alt=""></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.seawheeze.com/">SeaWheeze Half - August 15, 2015</a></strong></p>

<p>But I got tickets! A race I love so much, I signed up a year in advance. This was literally one of my best experiences this year. It sold out in under a half hour, but both my mom and I managed to sign up.</p>
