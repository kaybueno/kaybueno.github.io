	<h1><a href="/6-21-2014/berry-picking.html">Berries in the Bay</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		June 21, 2014
	</div>

	<p>When I was little, my family used to go apple picking every fall. We’d ride the hay ride, pick more apples than we would ever eat, and buy a dozen apple donuts. I now realize this tradition was more for getting to binge on apple donuts than a love of picking apples.</p>

<p>This last weekend, J and I went to go relive my childhood by picking Olallieberries (a cross between a bunch of berries, most notably the blackberry) from a small farm down highway 1.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-QPtW6iX8xO0/U-K1s5_qJiI/AAAAAAAAFZA/wTdZn39DjvI/w955-h716-no/IMG_2094.JPG" alt="Kay picks berries yo"></p>

<p>We were (are?) like children. (And of course, we were the only people there without children, go figure.) We ran around trying to pick all the “best” berries. J kept telling me we had enough, we had too many berries, we would never eat this many. And I was pretty sure I could finish all of the berries in the car ride home. (Spoiler alert: I did not eat all the berries on the way home.) </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-OIZ9vwBLmzs/U-KwwXP8vyI/AAAAAAAAFWI/a3nQdR0jkzA/w955-h716-no/IMG_2082.JPG" alt="Serious berry haul"></p>

<p>After our serious berry haul, we made our way to Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park. A mouthful of a name, if you ask me. We started aimlessly walking around because we couldn’t find a map, and then ran into an ultra marathon trail run group, who were on their 35th mile. I then felt a little guilty about my long runs being 6 miles.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/CBgpwsm27tnbWLWhgB8PO8XYpIv5oOCh9jBQLqHBGXc=w578-h716-no" alt="But for real, it’s beautiful"></p>

<p>Since we had no destination, we eventually hit a river that cut off our path. The ultramarathoners were unreal amazing and just ran through the waist deep water like it was nothing. However. I was unprepared, so J and I scrambled across the rocks to get to the other side. Success! Our shoes only got a little wet, and I didn’t fall in. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-dyp46wIbqfo/U-K2YQrQBzI/AAAAAAAAFeQ/f4SlRyv4ukI/w537-h716-no/IMG_2122.JPG" alt="This is a river"></p>

<p>Ultimately, after crossing the river, we came upon a bunch of dead animals in the woods, and that seemed like a good sign to turn around, so we did. We hopped back in the car, drove home, and ate all the rest of the berries.</p>

<p>Should have picked more.</p>

	<div class="date">

	</div>

	<p>Ever find something decidedly cool, from an incredibly uncool place? J and I found out about Lazy Bear, an underground dinner you sign up for lottery style a few months ago. After months of putting our names in, we finally were chosen for this many many course experience. We thought we were cool, and hip, and maybe read it in the New York Times, or heard it from a food loving friend. </p>

<p>But no. It was Yelp. The number one rated “restaurant” in SF. Not so cool. The courses were all amazing, and there are so many, that I won’t describe every one in detail.</p>

<p>Let’s begin. I missed snapping photos of some of the initial courses, so, this is not representative of the full meal.</p>

	<h1><a href="/5-13-2014/moms-day-in-e-bay.html">Ziplining is for adults too!</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		May 13, 2014
	</div>

	<p>Our second day in Lake Tahoe, we didn’t want to kill ourselves with another hike, especially since we were snowed on the day before. Buuuuut, we both wanted to see balancing rock before we left.</p>

<p>We considered a few activities, kayaking, paddle boarding, zip lining, all the watersports were closed until Memorial Day. I really, really didn’t want to zipline. I thought it’d be super boring, since we did it in Costa Rica. But I caved in, and let J book it. We ended up getting a two for one deal though, and hell, I like coupons. :)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-MF3Q5JJ772c/U3G58nAFtFI/AAAAAAAABAA/wM2F13TCXSY/w1059-h706-no/kitt-glamour-rock.jpg" alt="!"></p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-p2Wu5OSegmM/U3G5t6LhPFI/AAAAAAAAA-0/L9mBHjTelr8/w1059-h706-no/dino-rock.jpg" alt="!"></p>

<p>J’s knees hurt, and it didn’t look like the gate to balancing rock was open. So we parked in a little outlet nearby. OMG. Best decision ever. It was like less than half a mile to the site. We ran around and took pictures. Since the rock entrance was closed, we were the only people there. Which made for a quiet morning.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-U05o7E1MZaQ/U3G59ZWoQ7I/AAAAAAAABAE/mtXwFnpk--0/w1059-h706-no/kitt-holding-rock.jpg" alt="!"></p>

<p>When you’re at balancing rock though, it almost feels like it could fall on you. It didn’t, but it feeeeels like it could.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-9qpPDSp4cHA/U3G5yQN2ExI/AAAAAAAAA_M/1FmU55iCiUM/w1059-h706-no/jon-holding-rock.jpg" alt="!"></p>

<p>Speaking of things falling, I’m the clumsiest person ever. I totally bit it and fell hard on my hands and knees walking back to the car. At the time, it didn’t seem like a big deal, you know? I just fell. I’m an adult. I should be able to handle it. But as we got on the road, I realized that I was bleeding through my yoga pants. We picked up some bandaids and alcohol wipes and cleaned up before getting to the high ropes course.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-i3orpttFHkk/U3WlqtTCPYI/AAAAAAAABDs/x5iwFnu546A/w504-h672-no/2014-05-11+13.42.47.jpg" alt="!"></p>

<p>Dude. It was insane.</p>

<p>Let me first point out that we were the only childless adults at the facility. But once we got past that, it was so cool. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-F_vh07mAtTA/U3WlrlNLctI/AAAAAAAABDU/fxL5zrvrpx4/s672-no/2014-05-11+15.11.44.jpg" alt="!"></p>

<p>Basically, they rigged up 5 different levels of treetop courses. They all involved some level of balancing, climbing, jumping, and zip lining. You would clip in and climb up a ladder, onto a platform, have to tightrope across to the next platform, and then skateboard in mid-air into a weirdly woven web that you climb across to a zipline. And repeat with a billion different challenges.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-vfE1FnLv0nI/U3WlqBLu4UI/AAAAAAAABDE/arS7FNkUljk/s672-no/2014-05-11+14.32.30+HDR.jpg" alt="!"></p>

<p>We did every single one of them. It was crazy fun. This was also the Sunday of Mother’s Day, so there were a lot of moms there. I felt really bad at some points because a lot of the moms, despite being in decent to good shape, were really afraid of failing at the courses, so they didn’t even try.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-2V7j8TJf0EM/U3WlrE5onqI/AAAAAAAABD4/awH9-tJZTIY/w896-h672-no/2014-05-11+13.56.19.jpg" alt="!"></p>

<p>To be fair though, it was hard. The next day I was so sore, I wanted to puke.</p>

	<h1><a href="/5-12-2014/emerald-bay-day-1.html">Tahoe Adventures. Or how to get both sunburn and hypothermia in the same day.</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		May 12, 2014
	</div>

	<p>When you’re not living near your mom, but all your friends are booked for mothers day, it’s a sweet time to go away. J (the boyfriend) and I decided to head up a few hours north to Lake Tahoe to get active. We weren’t traveling in style by any means. We stayed in a sleazy, but incredibly cheap motel. Despite kind of being a baby about these things, I have to admit, it wasn’t actually that bad. It barely cost us anything. And though the room smelled of stale smoke, and our blankets were a little thin and ripped, we barely spent any time here, and the cost cutting was worth it.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ALSpo8GhuWg/U3G6BswcjqI/AAAAAAAABAc/yCWLKuDD7_s/w1059-h706-no/kitt-jon-emerald-bay-2.jpg" alt="K &amp; J at Emerald Bay"></p>

<p>We wanted to do a bunch with our weekend away. We expected a big hike and some kayaking. It was supposed to rain day one, but it was only a 20% chance, so we decided to risk our giant hike on the first day.</p>

<p>We hit up Emerald Bay. My favorite hike so far in Tahoe. It’s a little C-shaped bay with gorgeous mountain views, rock formations, and a formidable waterfall. My advice, don’t even plan to park near the trailhead. On our way to the trail were so over-excited when we saw the top of the waterfall and the gorgeous scenery that we spent a ton of time before even getting to the trailhead to get pictures. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-7XMMRnZaJz0/U3G54uBbo0I/AAAAAAAAA_0/_GgdAPETEYA/w1059-h706-no/kitt-emerald-bay.jpg" alt="Kitt at Emerald Bay"></p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-vmsdh8wRBns/U3G6CrBx5ZI/AAAAAAAABBM/3cEAwTKPc58/w1059-h706-no/kitt-top-waterfall.jpg" alt="So many pictures of Kitt at Emerald Bay"></p>

<p>We started the descent from the parking lot to the trailhead around 1pm, and took even more time to play around photographing the waterfall that was half a mile away. Despite a disappointing winter, there’s still enough snow melting to sport a raging falls. Armed with a new camera, and a lot of energy from morning caffeine, we spent an hour playing around with shots in the falls.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-8FrHiYUeBPU/U3G5ptYPomI/AAAAAAAAA-Y/u5EXIuhmAn4/w1059-h706-no/artsy-waterfall.jpg" alt="Waterfalls!">
<img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-zaNoDJUZX3o/U3G52VZqqxI/AAAAAAAAA_c/8WB1168HRo8/w477-h716-no/kitt-artsy-waterfall.jpg" alt="Waterfalls!"></p>

<p>The day was beautiful, it was a brisk but sunny 50 degrees. We started on what we planned to be a 12 mile hike, out to the next state park (D L Bliss) and back. Emerald Bay is beautiful, you see amazing coastal views, hike a slightly variated trail, and enjoy the mountains and the bay. It’s not a hard trail by any stretch, just long and a little windy.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-1E5SI_WcDXc/U3G-1CLYXgI/AAAAAAAABBc/pJtpDINsxqM/w896-h672-no/laketahoecollage.png" alt="Collage of all my pictures !"></p>

<p>A few miles in, the sky started to drop these tiny balls of snow. It was like being showered with little dippin’ dots. We thought this was adorable, and funny. J and I figured, it’s better than rain. The little ice balls just bounced off us as we walked. Note to self, if it starts precipitating, don’t continue.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ZRAe8SbZ74I/U3G_Tc2YPVI/AAAAAAAABB4/hUXa0Y1tXlk/w504-h672-no/2014-05-10+16.16.14.jpg" alt="J in snow"></p>

<p>We got to the half-way point, 6 miles in, and snow started just pouring from the sky. It was so thick, you could barely see a few feet in front of you. Armed with only hoodies and athletic pants we trekked back. It was adventurous and stupid. We became walking snowmen, with snow sticking to our hair and cotton clothes. At some points it was like hiking through a snow globe and at other points we felt like we were stuck in the arctic.  The last mile, my body was wet with a miserable mix of sweat and snow. But looking back on it, despite the cold and the snow, it was worth it. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ZaVky7eMOKI/U3G_T3_8wiI/AAAAAAAABB8/6YjDIrkLo40/w504-h672-no/2014-05-10+16.14.23.jpg" alt="Walks in snow!"></p>

<p>But of course, as soon as we got to the car (and brushed all the snow off of it). The sky cleared up, and the day went back to 50 degrees. At least we didn’t get snowed on day 2. :)</p>
