	<p>A week or two ago we had a completely open day. The weather&#39;s been great, and so we wanted to get outdoors and try a new trail, stretch our legs out a bit from a long week of screens, screens and more screens.</p>

<p>So the boyfriend and I hit up Cataract Falls. When we got there it was chilly. Like, when you live in California, sometimes you forget how cold it can get. We planned the hike around a 6 mile loop that promised coastal views and ended at Cataract Falls. The coastal bit, honestly, was just so boring. Basically no elevation change, gentle weather, and mediocre views. It would have been just as good to walk on a track, or in a mall, god.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-l-G2xUF9wVI/U02toZo_udI/AAAAAAAAAQM/SmToLc4_m9I/w955-h716-no/14+-+20" alt="Alt text"></p>

<p>Five miles through, and with way too much energy left, we made it to the falls area. Not tired, we decided to tack on an extra 5 mile loop to the hike to get to the base of the waterfall and back. </p>

<p>So we took off, running down the falls trail, jumping down stairs, speedng through straight paths. I had that nagging feeling you get in the back of your mind, &quot;Hmmm, this seems like a lot of downhill.&quot; But, like an idiot, I ignored the fact that I was basically hurtling my body down a mountain.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-jj7eWdlnkg0/U02toc6YQcI/AAAAAAAAAQo/yzTdVWoy93Y/w537-h716-no/14+-+16" alt="Alt text"></p>

<p>The water was gorgeous, and made up for our lack luster hike. But fuck man, we had to climb all the way back up. 1,400 feet elevation to scale, basically 140 floors to tackle. Initially, I was dying, and expected to vomit, curl up and die (I think my boyfriend was embarrassed of me at this point. Haha). But after the first few &quot;flights&quot; of steps, my body just stopped caring.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, it sucked the whole way up. I was a disgusting sweaty mess. But I stopped taking breaks and just pushed through the bulk of it. I felt pretty bad ass. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-BZk_KutFwlo/U02toXyfGyI/AAAAAAAAAMQ/1jaox2je8G0/w955-h716-no/14+-+25" alt="Alt te"></p>

<p>We got to the top and thought we were basically done with the loop, but we still had a mile and a half to go. Longest mile and a half of our lives, we were cold, tired, and our quads were ready to fall off. When we got to the car, all I wanted to do was sit, forever.</p>

<p>We ended up ordering in and just chilling, accomplishing nothing more than a super steep 10 mile hike that day. </p>

	<p>When you’re not living near your mom, but all your friends are booked for mothers day, it’s a sweet time to go away. J (the boyfriend) and I decided to head up a few hours north to Lake Tahoe to get active. We weren’t traveling in style by any means. We stayed in a sleazy, but incredibly cheap motel. Despite kind of being a baby about these things, I have to admit, it wasn’t actually that bad. It barely cost us anything. And though the room smelled of stale smoke, and our blankets were a little thin and ripped, we barely spent any time here, and the cost cutting was worth it.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ALSpo8GhuWg/U3G6BswcjqI/AAAAAAAABAc/yCWLKuDD7_s/w1059-h706-no/kitt-jon-emerald-bay-2.jpg" alt="K &amp; J at Emerald Bay"></p>

<p>We wanted to do a bunch with our weekend away. We expected a big hike and some kayaking. It was supposed to rain day one, but it was only a 20% chance, so we decided to risk our giant hike on the first day.</p>

<p>We hit up Emerald Bay. My favorite hike so far in Tahoe. It’s a little C-shaped bay with gorgeous mountain views, rock formations, and a formidable waterfall. My advice, don’t even plan to park near the trailhead. On our way to the trail were so over-excited when we saw the top of the waterfall and the gorgeous scenery that we spent a ton of time before even getting to the trailhead to get pictures. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-7XMMRnZaJz0/U3G54uBbo0I/AAAAAAAAA_0/_GgdAPETEYA/w1059-h706-no/kitt-emerald-bay.jpg" alt="Kitt at Emerald Bay"></p>

<p>We started the descent from the parking lot to the trailhead around 1pm, and took even more time to play around photographing the waterfall that was half a mile away. Despite a disappointing winter, there’s still enough snow melting to sport a raging falls. Armed with a new camera, and a lot of energy from morning caffeine, we spent an hour playing around with shots in the falls.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-8FrHiYUeBPU/U3G5ptYPomI/AAAAAAAAA-Y/u5EXIuhmAn4/w1059-h706-no/artsy-waterfall.jpg" alt="Waterfalls!">

<p>The day was beautiful, it was a brisk but sunny 50 degrees. We started on what we planned to be a 12 mile hike, out to the next state park (D L Bliss) and back. Emerald Bay is beautiful, you see amazing coastal views, hike a slightly variated trail, and enjoy the mountains and the bay. It’s not a hard trail by any stretch, just long and a little windy.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-1E5SI_WcDXc/U3G-1CLYXgI/AAAAAAAABBc/pJtpDINsxqM/w896-h672-no/laketahoecollage.png" alt="Collage of all my pictures !"></p>

<p>A few miles in, the sky started to drop these tiny balls of snow. It was like being showered with little dippin’ dots. We thought this was adorable, and funny. J and I figured, it’s better than rain. The little ice balls just bounced off us as we walked. Note to self, if it starts precipitating, don’t continue.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ZRAe8SbZ74I/U3G_Tc2YPVI/AAAAAAAABB4/hUXa0Y1tXlk/w504-h672-no/2014-05-10+16.16.14.jpg" alt="J in snow"></p>

<p>We got to the half-way point, 6 miles in, and snow started just pouring from the sky. It was so thick, you could barely see a few feet in front of you. Armed with only hoodies and athletic pants we trekked back. It was adventurous and stupid. We became walking snowmen, with snow sticking to our hair and cotton clothes. At some points it was like hiking through a snow globe and at other points we felt like we were stuck in the arctic.  The last mile, my body was wet with a miserable mix of sweat and snow. But looking back on it, despite the cold and the snow, it was worth it. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ZaVky7eMOKI/U3G_T3_8wiI/AAAAAAAABB8/6YjDIrkLo40/w504-h672-no/2014-05-10+16.14.23.jpg" alt="Walks in snow!"></p>

<p>But of course, as soon as we got to the car (and brushed all the snow off of it). The sky cleared up, and the day went back to 50 degrees. At least we didn’t get snowed on day 2. :)</p>

	<p>Our second day in Lake Tahoe, we didn’t want to kill ourselves with another hike, especially since we were snowed on the day before. Buuuuut, we both wanted to see balancing rock before we left.</p>

<p>We considered a few activities, kayaking, paddle boarding, zip lining, all the watersports were closed until Memorial Day. I really, really didn’t want to zipline. I thought it’d be super boring, since we did it in Costa Rica. But I caved in, and let J book it. We ended up getting a two for one deal though, and hell, I like coupons. :)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-MF3Q5JJ772c/U3G58nAFtFI/AAAAAAAABAA/wM2F13TCXSY/w1059-h706-no/kitt-glamour-rock.jpg" alt="!"></p>

<p>J’s knees hurt, and it didn’t look like the gate to balancing rock was open. So we parked in a little outlet nearby. OMG. Best decision ever. It was like less than half a mile to the site. We ran around and took pictures. Since the rock entrance was closed, we were the only people there. Which made for a quiet morning.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-U05o7E1MZaQ/U3G59ZWoQ7I/AAAAAAAABAE/mtXwFnpk--0/w1059-h706-no/kitt-holding-rock.jpg" alt="!"></p>

<p>When you’re at balancing rock though, it almost feels like it could fall on you. It didn’t, but it feeeeels like it could.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-9qpPDSp4cHA/U3G5yQN2ExI/AAAAAAAAA_M/1FmU55iCiUM/w1059-h706-no/jon-holding-rock.jpg" alt="!"></p>

<p>Speaking of things falling, I’m the clumsiest person ever. I totally bit it and fell hard on my hands and knees walking back to the car. At the time, it didn’t seem like a big deal, you know? I just fell. I’m an adult. I should be able to handle it. But as we got on the road, I realized that I was bleeding through my yoga pants. We picked up some bandaids and alcohol wipes and cleaned up before getting to the high ropes course.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-i3orpttFHkk/U3WlqtTCPYI/AAAAAAAABDs/x5iwFnu546A/w504-h672-no/2014-05-11+13.42.47.jpg" alt="!"></p>

<p>Dude. It was insane.</p>

<p>Let me first point out that we were the only childless adults at the facility. But once we got past that, it was so cool. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-F_vh07mAtTA/U3WlrlNLctI/AAAAAAAABDU/fxL5zrvrpx4/s672-no/2014-05-11+15.11.44.jpg" alt="!"></p>

<p>Basically, they rigged up 5 different levels of treetop courses. They all involved some level of balancing, climbing, jumping, and zip lining. You would clip in and climb up a ladder, onto a platform, have to tightrope across to the next platform, and then skateboard in mid-air into a weirdly woven web that you climb across to a zipline. And repeat with a billion different challenges.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-vfE1FnLv0nI/U3WlqBLu4UI/AAAAAAAABDE/arS7FNkUljk/s672-no/2014-05-11+14.32.30+HDR.jpg" alt="!"></p>

<p>We did every single one of them. It was crazy fun. This was also the Sunday of Mother’s Day, so there were a lot of moms there. I felt really bad at some points because a lot of the moms, despite being in decent to good shape, were really afraid of failing at the courses, so they didn’t even try.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-2V7j8TJf0EM/U3WlrE5onqI/AAAAAAAABD4/awH9-tJZTIY/w896-h672-no/2014-05-11+13.56.19.jpg" alt="!"></p>

<p>To be fair though, it was hard. The next day I was so sore, I wanted to puke.</p>

	<p>When I was little, my family used to go apple picking every fall. We’d ride the hay ride, pick more apples than we would ever eat, and buy a dozen apple donuts. I now realize this tradition was more for getting to binge on apple donuts than a love of picking apples.</p>

<p>This last weekend, J and I went to go relive my childhood by picking Olallieberries (a cross between a bunch of berries, most notably the blackberry) from a small farm down highway 1.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-QPtW6iX8xO0/U-K1s5_qJiI/AAAAAAAAFZA/wTdZn39DjvI/w955-h716-no/IMG_2094.JPG" alt="Kay picks berries yo"></p>

<p>We were (are?) like children. (And of course, we were the only people there without children, go figure.) We ran around trying to pick all the “best” berries. J kept telling me we had enough, we had too many berries, we would never eat this many. And I was pretty sure I could finish all of the berries in the car ride home. (Spoiler alert: I did not eat all the berries on the way home.) </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-OIZ9vwBLmzs/U-KwwXP8vyI/AAAAAAAAFWI/a3nQdR0jkzA/w955-h716-no/IMG_2082.JPG" alt="Serious berry haul"></p>

<p>After our serious berry haul, we made our way to Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park. A mouthful of a name, if you ask me. We started aimlessly walking around because we couldn’t find a map, and then ran into an ultra marathon trail run group, who were on their 35th mile. I then felt a little guilty about my long runs being 6 miles.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/CBgpwsm27tnbWLWhgB8PO8XYpIv5oOCh9jBQLqHBGXc=w578-h716-no" alt="But for real, it’s beautiful"></p>

<p>Since we had no destination, we eventually hit a river that cut off our path. The ultramarathoners were unreal amazing and just ran through the waist deep water like it was nothing. However. I was unprepared, so J and I scrambled across the rocks to get to the other side. Success! Our shoes only got a little wet, and I didn’t fall in. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-dyp46wIbqfo/U-K2YQrQBzI/AAAAAAAAFeQ/f4SlRyv4ukI/w537-h716-no/IMG_2122.JPG" alt="This is a river"></p>

<p>Ultimately, after crossing the river, we came upon a bunch of dead animals in the woods, and that seemed like a good sign to turn around, so we did. We hopped back in the car, drove home, and ate all the rest of the berries.</p>

<p>Should have picked more.</p>

	<p>This summer our vacations have been beautifully formulaic. We choose a place a few hours out from San Francisco. Book a shitty motel in the area. Then hike, bike, and eat the local food.</p>

<p>Since day one in SF, J has been wanting to go to Shasta. So bam! We did. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-5IiGWdT2Upg/U-K9vta2UkI/AAAAAAAAGOQ/DAkb-vXkHRE/w537-h716-no/IMG_2442.JPG" alt="We made it!"></p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-gGut2AlXKqI/U-K8JvIqWlI/AAAAAAAAGFo/i4soP8Met8U/w537-h716-no/IMG_2393.JPG" alt="Rocks!"></p>

<p>Because we are nowhere near cool enough, we decided not to actually hike Shasta itself. Mostly since we wanted to spend our time just looking at it. And also because, it takes like a whole day, and it was 108 degrees outside. So hot.</p>

<p>We ended up at Castle Crags, a pretty sweet hike. We started from a parking area, and climbed. Since we believed the things we read on the internet, we hear this was going to be a 5 mile hike, total. Unfortunately, since we never looked at a map, we didn’t realize that it was 5 miles to the top, and 5 back down. Oops.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Ec8vG2XtRLxBrsHopGNMB6vn09VLzOxqTkPV25TtZ5I=w1062-h682-no" alt=""></p>

<p>The hike had about 2000 ft elevation gain over a 5 mile windy path. And then the last 500 feet was a lot of scrambling up rocks. Which I pretty much hate the most ever. I always feel, regardless of how much actual safety there is, that I’m going to fall down. So after a few minutes of scrambling, I told J to go ahead, and I’d wait. I was tired, it was hot, we were running out of water. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Y8PdFkfn1xo/U-K9gaSGoaI/AAAAAAAAGMw/aAIbmjvNGvE/w403-h716-no/IMG_2431.JPG" alt="J summits crags. Balla’."></p>

<p>He made it to the top, it was amazing and beautiful, and I’m still glad I didn’t go.</p>

<p>Fortunately, on the way down, we stopped at this small, .2 mile hike to Indian Springs. Where there was potable water! I have never been so happy in the world ever for potable water. It was beautiful and amazing, and the best thing ever. We drank a lot of spring water, and then ran down the mountain for 5 miles. </p>

<p>I took a shower that flooded the entire bathroom. But I must say, a crappy motel bed and threadbare blankets never felt so good.</p>

	<p>If you’ve taken a peek at my Instagram. You may have noticed I was in Hawaii last week! Normally, my boyfriend and I are connected to our laptops all day, every day for work. We wanted to get away from the bright screens, and so we took a laptop-free vacation.</p>

<p>J and I left bright and early in the morning, I was super excited and overly awake on the plane while J fell asleep the moment we hit the seats. Fortunately, we scored some great exit row seats so I was able stretch my legs.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/643vSB_GhE9l9C7UJzRK2UDbTw3a-WSxEoEKFIrLSpg=w667-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>The minute the plane landed, we went to grab a bite to eat. We stopped at Da Kitchen to pick up some local cuisine.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bi4cp5quugepcfO5j9NJsKi54VOQfTtzjLFdUAwwoOQ=w587-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Despite my smile, turns out traditional Hawaiian food isn’t really our thing. I got a pork sandwich, and J ordered a giant Loco Moco (not knowing what a loco moco was, and not knowing that he was ordering the biggest one on the menu). Da Kitchen did a great job cooking our meal, but it was a little too much, and too greasy.</p>

<p>To pay for our food sins we decided to start the afternoon off hiking.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-fmMhRvAEhP4/VB-pmA6CsSI/AAAAAAAALbk/BRcUUpVNCAM/w1062-h708-no/bestofwaiheejon.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>We hit the Waihee Ridge trail up around 1pm. Despite everything on the internet telling us this hike would only be good in the morning, or that finding the parking and trailhead was difficult, we had no problem with either. Google Maps saved the day once again.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/3GxWU7p8FWWH9p38yPUtsupnU9ZK6ZQ9-KR-dZDmJ78=w496-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>The ridge trail is basically all uphill, and has a bunch of really beautiful lookout points. Every time I thought we couldn’t gain more altitude, we did! It switches between forested and exposed, and is definitely on the challenging side of trails. J and I loved it. </p>

<p>Despite the serious climb, the views are totally worth it, you feel like you’re in the middle of a Jurassic Park set. The clouds, waterfalls, and super lush foliage are unlike anything in Northern California. The only thing I’d change? J and I only brought one water bottle for the both of us. We definitely needed two.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-8REPgwSmKTU/VB-oZbsPnYI/AAAAAAAALUg/21BC88kBKAI/w1062-h708-no/IMG_0654.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>We ended the day at the Mana Kai Maui in Kihei. Due to a little switch up with our room, we ended up upgraded into one of their condos. The condo was totally adequate, nothing to write home about. But the balcony, or lanai as all of Maui (and possibly Hawaii seems to call it), was amazing.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-igiayIil4to/VB9yiRsMDBI/AAAAAAAAKF0/NcEN12L-ihw/w1062-h708-no/IMG_0678.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>With that view, we spent a lot of time on the balcony watching the sunset, the surf, and just chilling. Since the condo came with a kitchen we were sure to grab fruit at the local market. I seriously improved my pineapple cutting skills. I’m a real fruit ninja now.</p>

<p>But we’re home now! I’ll do some entries over the next few days about the rest of our trip. While vacation is nice, I’m excited to be back into routine. Soylent, running, yoga and work.</p>

	<p>Road to Hana! Road to Hana! Road to Hana! </p>

<p>Not to say it’s name too many times, but Road to Hana is one of my favorite parts about Maui. It’s a great reason to get a jeep, take the top off, and drive a few hours down a long windy road that goes to nowhere. (And buy, and consume a lot of banana bread along the way!)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-s5Kco6FBw5E/VB-oufZyDPI/AAAAAAAALWo/1sIPJvAu2SA/w1062-h708-no/IMG_0856.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>So of course, J and I rented a Jeep (after a lot of begging on my part for a Jeep) and set out early on day 3 to embark on the Road to Hana. It’s a drive that could be done back and forth in one day, but J and I wanted to hike a bunch along the way, and do the Pipiwai trail at the Oheo Gulch. So we decided to spend a night in Hana. </p>

<p>This was almost disastrous, as we planned this trip to Hawaii just the week before we flew here. And little did we know, the original day we planned to do Road to Hana, there was a huge foot race/relay on the route. (We’re talking thousands of people running on a one lane road) Thankfully, when we tried to book a hotel, the receptionist told us we were choosing the worst dates for this. Phew.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/NDWzD7LDKbOi2GbZdMLKyZHHkiFU53FG0DhuS5v_ZmQ=w489-h715-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Road to Hana is a journey, filled with twisty passes and one laned bridges, and J and I didn’t want to go it alone. So we downloaded the Road to Hana GyPSy app on our phones. Though the narrator is a little cheesy, without him, we would have never stumbled across things like rainbow eucalyptus!</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-_ILasbMsR7E/VB-omN9PjoI/AAAAAAAALV4/wa5ecKZL-3c/w477-h716-no/IMG_0804.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-f6Goa6m-3J0/VB-olMsqzqI/AAAAAAAALV0/uOIYvt1i88A/w477-h716-no/IMG_0796.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Which are, in my mind, the prettiest trees I’ve ever seen. (Take that cherry blossoms). We also ended up in Keanae. A quiet town with pretty black rock beaches. One of the great things about this narrated, GPS based tour, is that the narrator gives you five important things to do on the road. So there’s no analysis paralysis of trying to pick the best places to stop along the way.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-EPNa5-3laKc/VB91UcXnVnI/AAAAAAAAKXw/cWRt7PIRZow/w1062-h708-no/IMG_0823.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>At the end of the road, we stopped in Hana. We found a super cute hotel called the Hana Kai Maui (of no relation to the Mana Kai Maui). It was seriously one of the most, clean, modern places we stayed. It felt beachy without having that fake resort feel. And the kitchen was high tech. I wanted to live there forever.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-EDQooL44HU0/VB92YQvF9dI/AAAAAAAAKeA/mzgYupFIDrU/w1062-h708-no/IMG_0873.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Since we were on the east side of the island, I hopped into bed as early as possible so I could wake up and catch the sunrise the next day at 5:30 am. </p>

<p>What’s the last adventure you took?</p>

	<p>Ughhh. I’ve been sick this entire weekend, and looking at pictures of me hiking and healthy in Hawaii was just too much to handle. But I wanted to get the rest of the trip up on the blog before I lose any more momentum and just start blogging cute exercise clothes I want to buy or something.</p>

<p>J and I were last in Hana. Having completed the infamous Road to Hana trip. It was our first (and only) night on the east side of the island. So we wanted to catch sunrise.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-FSauXjXzYew/VB-ojuZn_SI/AAAAAAAALVg/PBok97Nk0HM/w1062-h708-no/IMG_0770.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Needless to say, it was worth it.</p>

<p>Getting up for sunrise made it easy for us to grab an early start. After the sun came up, we headed out to the Oheo Gulch, aka the Seven Sacred Pools. It’s technically an extension of Haleakala National Park, although it only has two trails. The trail down to the pools, and the Pipiwai trail. We did both.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-0Dr3qSBlCjY/VB-o5uw9KHI/AAAAAAAALXU/mlyxhqwko60/w1062-h708-no/IMG_0950.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>The trek down to the pools is short, sweet, and passes by that giant tree you see above. Unfortunately, during our trip, the pools were pretty dry, with only one, maybe two to swim in. If you don’t bring your suit (we didn’t) there’s not a whole lot to see at the pools. It’s a great place to float, relax, and grab a nice tan, but not much else. You can see the swimmers behind Jon’s head in this snap at the pools.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-CDezCLEVcLY/VB-o-DtnmxI/AAAAAAAALXo/gfPzABdMwI8/w1062-h708-no/IMG_0998.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>So we headed to the Pipiwai trail. This is one of those hikes that really makes you wait for the good parts. It was 80 or 90 degrees, humid, and most of the waterfalls along the way were pretty dry. Out of need for shade (and a break from walking on an exposed trail uphill) we stopped to climb a tree.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-mLGFEyfU9lM/VB-pFHBlbSI/AAAAAAAALYQ/ReaYECKIg74/w477-h716-no/IMG_1020.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>After a mile and a half in or so (doesn’t sound like much until your ass is sweating, hiking up hill, with no shade). You reach the bamboo forest. When I read about this before going, I was kind of underwhelmed. Like “Woo hoo, what’s so cool about a bunch of bamboo?”</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AN6al0HCxBU/VB-pJqZY2CI/AAAAAAAALYk/GYgBh4tlqIQ/w477-h716-no/IMG_1025.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>I’ll tell you what! Bamboo sounds like deep, hollow, wind chimes whenever a breeze rolls through. Add that to the fact that our path was shaded, and J and I thought it was the greatest thing ever. </p>

<p>It felt pretty surreal to walk through the bamboo though, it’s just not a plant or experience we ever get at home.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-N5e9UihtbT0/VB-pJ0C3HvI/AAAAAAAALYo/wX2JecS77pc/w1062-h708-no/IMG_1029.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>After what seems like a lot of bamboo. You hit the end! Which is this beautiful waterfall. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-zWSDob6NLq4/VB-pLv1NOJI/AAAAAAAALYw/_bil7P3IRLo/w1062-h708-no/IMG_1035.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>The sign we’re standing in front of said to not cross it, or fear getting swept away and dying. However, the current ahead was nothing more than a trickle, so we (and basically the other 20 people who hiked there) went past the sign. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7IK926oKYFM/VB-pRNkY7vI/AAAAAAAALZM/mqR1kXn5D6c/w477-h716-no/IMG_1050.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>That’s the entire falls (with J at the bottom for scale). It was huge, and beautiful. But very very slim. A lot of the falls were almost dry when we visited. And like the pools at it’s base, there were groups of people who came to the falls to swim. So, word to the wise, in Maui, basically, always wear a suit. Or, always be swimming… Or something</p>

<p>We hiked back to the car. Left Hana, and got lunch. We stopped at the Naihiku market and J got the most amazing fried ahi tuna ever.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-pg45aJCrsgg/VB8mfREAfeI/AAAAAAAALgU/TfEffExsFVA/w884-h716-no/IMG_3325.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>It doesn’t look like much, but the fish was fresh caught, and fried in front of us, and was probably, no joke, the best food we had on Maui. The passion fruit, aka lilikoi, aka get in my stomach best fruit ever, was good too.</p>

<p>We finished our drive, took some pictures of the scenery (which is beautiful, even if J doesn’t look enthused in the photo below) and went back for a relaxing evening in Wailea.</p>

	</div>
	<p>After a few days in Maui, we decided to hop on over to the Big Island. While there were lava reports on the radio, we didn’t see any active lava. We didn’t think it would be in good spirits to tour on someone else’s devastation. So instead we spent a lot of time at Volcanoes National Park exploring previous eruption sites.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-FI4O0ZC6V_0/VB9vWUX-wHI/AAAAAAAAJyo/IRAWmfKDdoY/w1038-h692-no/IMG_1168.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>We woke up early the morning after our flight to head over to the park. We wanted to start the day by stretching our legs, so, we hiked the Kīlauea Iki Trail to the Thurston lava tube. It’s a 6 mile hike into what was once a lake of lava. Having since dried out, the crater is a great place to explore volcanic scenery. Getting there early led to much more amazing pictures. By 10 am, tons of tourist buses had offloaded, filling the crater.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/8qeoFChDldhfzPzB3fzGqYFORHe0C4at18xwqGRa77U=w524-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>We learned a lot about what happens after a volcanic eruption, and getting to see the rocks and crags up close was great.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-WYWjWGiFGro/VB9vgECbLEI/AAAAAAAAJzI/rXAawJudE-M/w477-h716-no/IMG_1195.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>J was really into the learning aspect of the crater, and I was really into the making fun of J for learning so much about a crater aspect.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_sLeHtxIGEim-Vqw5G2xjIk1T1Zn36EIWOOrocTl40Q=w581-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Though it’s a kind of random picture, a few days before, I had caught a surfboard with my arm while surfing, and had developed a pretty serious bruise. I wanted to preserve it with a photo. Better my arm than my face, I guess. :)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/P6oRx7G0ZmDhOs2utVWKvX-H9khU3RxxzumJRHE1wN4=w979-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>We scaled out of the crater and into the lava tube, where bus, upon tour bus was parked. The tube is a great in and out jaunt, but it didn’t really offer much when compared to the crater. And the pictures inside made my inner photographer cry. With all the flash, poor lighting, and people everywhere, it didn’t lead to great pictures, or a great experience.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Zc_vJJbFJ7E/VB8vV6SO6tI/AAAAAAAAJOA/ro2vLORrjSE/w955-h716-no/IMG_3524.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>After, we drove the chain of craters road. The views were awesome, but the road was more hyped that we’d have liked. It’s a 20-30 mile road that stops where a lava flow crossed the road in 2003, blocking the path.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Gm7oRBZz8Z0/VB9vml2pFNI/AAAAAAAAJ0E/wfQUPLYJOEE/w1038-h692-no/IMG_1219.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>At the end of the day, we saw our first real lava sighting. We drove to the Jaggar Musuem to watch the lava out of the Halema&#39;uma&#39;u Crater. It was a really beautiful experience. We got in right before sundown, and stayed until sunset. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-bq7B-XPq2sA/VB-UmRfImzI/AAAAAAAALR0/HUnRO8WOK0Q/w808-h538-no/IMG_1119-MOTION.gif" alt=""></p>
