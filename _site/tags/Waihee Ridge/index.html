	<p>If you’ve taken a peek at my Instagram. You may have noticed I was in Hawaii last week! Normally, my boyfriend and I are connected to our laptops all day, every day for work. We wanted to get away from the bright screens, and so we took a laptop-free vacation.</p>

<p>J and I left bright and early in the morning, I was super excited and overly awake on the plane while J fell asleep the moment we hit the seats. Fortunately, we scored some great exit row seats so I was able stretch my legs.</p>

<p>The minute the plane landed, we went to grab a bite to eat. We stopped at Da Kitchen to pick up some local cuisine.</p>

<p>Despite my smile, turns out traditional Hawaiian food isn’t really our thing. I got a pork sandwich, and J ordered a giant Loco Moco (not knowing what a loco moco was, and not knowing that he was ordering the biggest one on the menu). Da Kitchen did a great job cooking our meal, but it was a little too much, and too greasy.</p>

<p>To pay for our food sins we decided to start the afternoon off hiking.</p>

<p>We hit the Waihee Ridge trail up around 1pm. Despite everything on the internet telling us this hike would only be good in the morning, or that finding the parking and trailhead was difficult, we had no problem with either. Google Maps saved the day once again.</p>

<p>The ridge trail is basically all uphill, and has a bunch of really beautiful lookout points. Every time I thought we couldn’t gain more altitude, we did! It switches between forested and exposed, and is definitely on the challenging side of trails. J and I loved it. </p>

<p>Despite the serious climb, the views are totally worth it, you feel like you’re in the middle of a Jurassic Park set. The clouds, waterfalls, and super lush foliage are unlike anything in Northern California. The only thing I’d change? J and I only brought one water bottle for the both of us. We definitely needed two.</p>

<p>We ended the day at the Mana Kai Maui in Kihei. Due to a little switch up with our room, we ended up upgraded into one of their condos. The condo was totally adequate, nothing to write home about. But the balcony, or lanai as all of Maui (and possibly Hawaii seems to call it), was amazing.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-igiayIil4to/VB9yiRsMDBI/AAAAAAAAKF0/NcEN12L-ihw/w1062-h708-no/IMG_0678.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>With that view, we spent a lot of time on the balcony watching the sunset, the surf, and just chilling. Since the condo came with a kitchen we were sure to grab fruit at the local market. I seriously improved my pineapple cutting skills. I’m a real fruit ninja now.</p>

<p>But we’re home now! I’ll do some entries over the next few days about the rest of our trip. While vacation is nice, I’m excited to be back into routine. Soylent, running, yoga and work.</p>
