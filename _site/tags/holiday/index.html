	<h1><a href="/7-4-2014/fireworks.html">Fourth of July the Works</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		July 4, 2014
	</div>

	<p>I’m not a firework person. I’m not an America the beautiful person. I don’t get most rah-rah holidays to begin with. But I went to the local fireworks with family, and I took some cool pictures and have to share.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-1C8ZLrBs_Q4/U-K5azQXM8I/AAAAAAAAF04/_upJ65ewzsg/w537-h716-no/IMG_2259.JPG" alt="‘The works’"></p>

<p>Even though people camped out at the venue all day to get good seats. We arrived like 30 minutes before show time, and snagged great digs right where a funnel cake vendor was closing. (Note to friends, and hey, even enemies. Don’t watch how your funnel cakes are made. I would quicker eat mixed concrete.)</p>

<p>The show was set to music, which was actually pretty awesome, and they timed the explosions to hit key points in the songs. There were even little heart fireworks for a song about love. Unfortunately most were upside down, but it’s the thought that counts.</p>

<p>Despite taking about 120 fireworks pictures with my iPhone, none contain the heart. Cool story.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-tMmF3a6y9a4/U-K3D1BrSAI/AAAAAAAAFjo/hKx8pK1y-lY/w537-h716-no/IMG_2167.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>All together, it was actually pretty cool. Even if it meant I had to listen to Katy Perry’s firework song like 20 times. I was a huge nerd and took a bunch of pictures, filmed the entire finale, and said “oh my god” way too many times. </p>

<p>Who knows, maybe I’ll come around on the Fourth of July. Might be my favorite holiday next year.</p>

	<h1><a href="/12-15-2014/weekend-festivities.html">Weekend Festivities</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		December 15, 2014
	</div>

	<p>When I was a little kid, I had some serious expectations of who I’d end up as as an adult. I imagined have a seriously fabulous life, like the people (or let’s be real, characters) in most of the early 2000s reality shows. While sometimes, the inner 13 year old in me is sometimes disappointed my life didn’t turn out like Laguna Beach (the 24 year old in me is not disappointed. At all.), sometimes I have a weekend that makes me feel like my life is not too far away from a faked reality tv show.</p>

<p>It started with two Christmas parties. That looked something like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-GmXXmpKXm3o/VI8QlQ0TniI/AAAAAAAAQ3I/SunxVNHcRnI/w670-h447-no/7sutcy0774.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>Or maybe this:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-tTLFJjbVXLQ/VI8QlTCj6nI/AAAAAAAAQ3A/nvcLV5UmUnQ/w670-h447-no/7sutcy0780.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>J’s party had that adorable gif making photo booth, on top of a taco bar, a slider bar, an open bar, and a cookie decorating bar. :) Full disclosure, I am a terrible, terrible gingerbread person decorator, but a wonderful gingerbread eater.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/K7uLYS7RfS_ZJG4abwW4U1DoFOcHE392q1QGYvNawrAk=w914-h502-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Unlike the celebs, this basic b wore the same outfit both nights. If I’m honest, it was even the same look both nights. I screenshotted a snap to cherish the moment. I’ll have even more crazy photobooth photos soon.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Tq_KuR-OnYgeQwCAZqzehgHFM-G7FhW1h26p1VqX0hRD=w640-h1136-no" alt=""></p>

<p>After downing cake pops, charcuterie, alcohol laden hot chocolate, and much much more. (Like, you don’t even want to know how much more). I realized I needed to get off the holiday party buzz with some serious sweating, and healthy eating. So I signed myself up for a local 5k the morning after our second holiday party.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/XDsv8bsLY-fjdA0ZJKq3rz5Gp9N1LFhLkPhs0cpyZoD1=s915-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Best idea ever. The race was a serious blast, and I completed in a pretty reasonable time for a still kind of boozy 5k. 27:50. After the run, I hopped in the car with <a href="www.almostgettingittogether.com">Cassie</a>, and we met <a href="www.instagram.com/ginamarie_hlc">Gina</a> for brunch and a stroll around the dish.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/8rvnSNVpAi_aCCUiGo9vwRauDB9PCnVYDgSnCDTKrkP7=w527-h450-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Last, but not least (and possibly most delicious). The girls and I grabbed freezes at Pressed Juicery. Their vanilla almond milk, made into a smooth frozen yogurt, is maybe the best thing I ate all weekend, even including the cake pops. </p>

<p>I literally want to eat this every day. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/cuHmOC0XapeIOLUDcurJnkAxjxQMJZZIO03y6_SUwV4g=w838-h1355-no" alt=""></p>

<p>How was your weekend? Do you have any holiday party plans? </p>

	<h1><a href="/12-19-2014/washi-tape-tree.html">Christmas Decorations for Apartments - The Washi Tape Tree</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		December 19, 2014
	</div>

	<p>I live in a tiny little studio, I affectionately call the cardboard box. Housing prices are crazy in the Bay Area, so even if you have a relatively good job, you’re basically stuck with a room in an apartment from the late 1800s (beautiful victorians), or a unit in a complex built in the 1950s (ugly concrete/stucco boxes). I have the latter.</p>

<p>This year, our complex manager offered 100 dollars off January’s rent to anyone who decorated their apartment’s exterior. While some of the units have small yards, big windows, and cute entryways, my exterior is basically just a door. Decorating for apartments is hard enough, can&#39;t paint, can&#39;t leave a mark, no giant tear down DIY projects. So here’s how I made it work. (Because let’s be real, I am motivated by money!)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-CP0iEL7rgA4/VJRlTKNfWUI/AAAAAAAARbk/vESJfjF88do/w915-h1256-no/IMG_5464.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>This is my washi tape tree door. I don’t have any electrical outlets around my building, so I couldn’t really do a beautiful light display. And I’m shelling out for gifts right now, so I didn’t want to drop a ton of cash on decorations. The solution? Washi tape.</p>

<p>Washi tape is thin, colored, plastic-y tape that originated in Japan. It’s kind of like, thin plastic painter’s tape, or masking tape. It definitely doesn’t have the holding power of like, duct tape, but it comes in the most beautiful array of colors and patterns. And best of all, scotch is carrying it now, so I found a bunch of them at target, and staples.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-2kDRd_AgUZc/VJRlWp7S14I/AAAAAAAARbs/-S-1YQkNx8s/w915-h686-no/IMG_5467.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>I had seen a lot of small, desk decoration type, washi tape trees on the internet. And decided to do it on a bigger scale. I basically freehanded the tree, and then added the decorations. </p>

<p>Before the mini ball ornaments, I tried a tree with tinsel. While I loved the tinsel texture, the weight of the garland made it so I had to constantly add more tape to it. And the abstract and messy nature of tinsel took away from the tree shape.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/NXVEprJ1XeHMONXGU9TLR9bzAA2jwavX1NKwCDaRB34S=w915-h1083-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Washi tape’s major benefit to me, is that it doesn’t (or hasn’t) damaged my door in any way. I removed the garland with no sticky residue, and no paint pulled up. It’s a fun way to decorate, or let kids decorate the walls, door, etc, without having to worry about damage.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-eC8RF79_6YA/VJRlVr62qaI/AAAAAAAARb0/ariC5Dm-StM/w915-h694-no/IMG_5466.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>All in all, it was an incredibly cheap option. Less than 15 dollars. I spent ~3 dollars per roll of tape, ~50 cents for the bows, and ~4 dollars for a bag of mini ornaments. (To be fair, I had the cord from another project, so the string didn’t cost me any money.) And even better, I’ve finally met my neighbors because people keep stopping by to ask me about it. (Probably because they too want the 100 dollar credit, but I’ll blame it on my art skills.)</p>

<p>How are you decorating this year? Have you used washi tape before?</p>

	<h1><a href="/12-22-2014/holiday-cookie-baking.html">Weekend Recap - Family Baking Time</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		December 22, 2014
	</div>

	<p>Greetings from Chicago. I’m finally home for the holidays. </p>

<p>Do you ever have really terrible ideas you don’t realize are terrible until after you’re stuck? Welcome to me, with my flight home. For some reason, I thought it was a great idea to go with the cheapest Southwest one I could find. Which meant on Saturday, I was on a plane from 2:00pm-8:30pm. Total day killer.</p>

<p>I made up for my Saturday’s transgressions by spending time with family. I did some last minute shopping, and came across this train. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-mOyMJNq6oEg/VJeI4In2bkI/AAAAAAAARvM/TGSSp70rkVM/w593-h716-no/IMG_5489.JPG" alt="kay in train"></p>

<p>I wouldn’t have even noticed the train, or sat in it, or even posted about it, if it didn’t have a very very angry sign.</p>

<p>The sign said, and I quote “CHILDREN ONLY IN SEAT. NO CLIMBING OR HANGING. DO NOT DAMAGE. VIDEO MONITORING PRESENT!!!”</p>

<p>Post shopping, all the girls in the family (and my surprisingly-jaunty-after-getting-his-intestines-removed brother.) got together to bake and decorate cookies.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-nTZomQUI-qc/VJhSN1L1XjI/AAAAAAAARw4/CoIs0vbz_EM/w896-h672-no/cookiecollage.png" alt="cookie making"></p>

<p>The women in my family have been baking cookies since I was 4. Each year we end up taking on more and more cookies varieties (fortunately, we keep adding women to the family, by love or by birth). </p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/FbiuN6F-wgkBHZsQPPWa27A9pTzo2xL_wOf69t5pEeET=w586-h716-no" alt="The cookie table"> </p>

<p>Everyone’s cookies represent their individual baking, decorating or eating style. My youngest cousin topped everything in sprinkles, I used a small star point to fill my cookies, and my grandma dipped everything in chocolate. </p>

<p>Notable cookies are the “Pokeball” sugar cookie, and the “I will kill u” star. We’re not murderers here, it’s just that my brother is very allergic to red dye, and so my sister (who has a mean hand with a piping bag) always makes a few sarcastic cookies.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/FzE2HOdWqq9znzkRJhaqvaz7fluACFlrgRbGvHyZgqJ9=w896-h672-no" alt="i will kill u"></p>

<p>After 5 hours of flour, sugar, butter, and love. We finally finished and took a quick photo of the gang. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-5z031tOPR-U/VJePlVNXwLI/AAAAAAAARts/_OmUO5o7uEs/w955-h716-no/IMG_5567.JPG" alt="Candid family photo"></p>

<p>It’s memories like these that you don’t forget. Partially because it’s so much fun, and partially because that red frosting is never coming out of the carpet.</p>

<p>What does your family do for the holidays? Do you have a “signature” cookie?</p>

	<h1><a href="/12-24-2014/WIAW.html">WIAW - Christmas Eve Style</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		December 24, 2014
	</div>

	<p>Good morning! (Or really, whenever you happen to be reading this). Usually, on Wednesdays, I break down all the delicious things I eat for <a href="http://peasandcrayons.com/2014/12/merry-christmahanukwanzaakah-wiaw-205-2.html">WIAW</a>. And today isn’t any different, except that, this morning, we had our big family Christmas.</p>

<p>So this late blog, is brought to you by sugar-cookie, animal-shaped waffles. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-dGBlwomLlIc/VJsKKdOmRLI/AAAAAAAASJk/zjshDFpz-Mk/w896-h672-no/wafflecollage.png" alt="Waffles"></p>

<p>I’ve been home, in Chicago for the week, so aside from the time change, the weather change, and the change in scenery, my eating schedule also feels wonky. Lunch and dinner feel too early, all the food tastes different, etc. By Wednesday, I was kind of craving my normal.</p>

<p>One of the great things about having homogenous work offices is it’s easy to get similar food everywhere. So after the serious cookie overload, I was ready to get something a little healthier in me.</p>

<p>I started with fruit and a biscotti. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/TqRyscLqsRDqSU7ALcZdxwF6gmaetqfPRyOlLRufr8_h=w973-h716-no" alt="Breakfast"></p>

<p>Lunch was a salad with pico de gallo, corn, olives, and root vegetable puree, carrot ginger soup, and a cut of arctic char (Which I found out, after watching Alton Brown on the plane for 5 hours, is a close relative of both salmon, and trout, aka delicious).</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-SLtaXMmflME/VJhprozEsDI/AAAAAAAARzM/GIkJ_mHWNio/w1041-h599-no/IMG_5578.JPG" alt="Lunch"></p>

<p>Mid-day, the chef team put out vats of hot chocolate. Who was I to say no? </p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Q-AtKJkaJ5zaBuMOsJ_Lvxp643pjACsSExKy3DUVPpIn=w616-h716-no" alt="Hot chocolate snack"></p>

<p>I actually didn’t end up finishing it all, and when I washed out my cup, found a layer of sprinkles caked onto the bottom. Can we say, addiction?</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-g6-NmHLdqHs/VJsIl4H3XbI/AAAAAAAASJY/YuexHojVwYI/s672-no/IMG_5697.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>When I got home I had a tea and some sugar cookies. Not like I was ever going to escape those. I think every day of the holidays should include some amount of cookies. 
Not pictured are the copious cups of coffee I’ve been drinking, and the small mountain of other sweets I’ve been enjoying since everyone is in a baking mood.</p>

<p>A merry, merry Christmas to those who celebrate it! I hope you all get wonderful gifts tomorrow, and stay close to family. While I rocked the gift giving and receiving today, tomorrow I get the best gift ever, because J lands in Chicago to spend the week with me. :)</p>

<p>What are you hoping to receive? What’s the best gift you’re giving? Have you eaten as much delicious food as I have recently?</p>
