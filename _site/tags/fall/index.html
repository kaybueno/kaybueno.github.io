	<h1><a href="/10-16-2014/woah-fall.html">Woooah, it's fall.</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		October 16, 2014
	</div>

	<p>Up until today, my life still felt like summer. California has been bright, sunny, and warm. I had yet to bundle up in anything more than a t-shirt. Heck, even the trees were still bright green.</p>

<p>But today, that all changed! Now, it’s unquestionably fall. And it all began with a pumpkin.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-zyYtyfJV3M0/VECHHx2RjqI/AAAAAAAAL4o/jKQ34uBCFcE/s716-no/IMG_3896.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>A 1600 pound pumpkin for that matter. Someone had delivered it to the office, and it was as tall as me (and I’m 5’10”.) And just… giant. All I could think of is how many muffins, scones, and spice lattes you could make with that sucker. Delicious.</p>

<p>Then, at lunch, I got roped into (read: I totally volunteered for) making decorations for my company’s Halloween party. It’s Alice in Wonderland themed (isn’t that the best? Spooky and whimsical without being cliche). So today I helped fold some of 800 paper roses.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-e0VbHCYZ4pU/VECHK6cMIyI/AAAAAAAAL7A/h9EWMwH_OWY/w955-h716-no/IMG_3894.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ZF2V5EM3i-8/VECHMOCKi6I/AAAAAAAAL60/68CytVOVMYg/w756-h716-no/IMG_3895.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Folding was a nice break from my typical daily work. The directions were super easy, and surprisingly, despite a bunch of us all working at once, the flowers turned out great. <a href="http://pldevents.com/how-to-paper-flowers/">This</a> is basically exactly what we did. Everyone at the table kept remarking that it felt like they were crafting for their wedding all over again, and how much they missed the DIY aspect of planning for it. By lunch end, we had knocked out about 100. The Queen’s maze is going to look great.</p>

<p>Decorating for Halloween and giant pumpkins started getting me in the fall mood. But then I walked into yoga tonight, and the class door was open to the outside, and it was freezing. Finally the temperature was telling me something. It’s fall.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-EZoSRD1DDwo/VECHNSPdIFI/AAAAAAAAL6k/43k4kG1bioA/w999-h716-no/IMG_3897.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>We closed the door and got to class. This yoga is called “Creative Yoga and Flow”, and it&#39;s the first yoga class I ever took. The first time I took from this instructor, when she was fixing my form, she gasped and cried out (to the entired class) “You need yoga! Your muscles are so tight. You work out too much with no yoga.” While simultaneously flattering (I work out!) and embarrassing (omg did everyone hear that), her class has been great for me to deepen my stretches in the basic poses. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-_bgZZCOtseE/VECHQI9fotI/AAAAAAAAL6s/_KwG6uo6btk/w906-h716-no/IMG_3899.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>As you can see, I’m ready with my mat, block and strap, well before the class starts. I can’t lie, I like to be on time. But my biggest pet peeve, is people who walk in late. 5-10 minutes late? Totally fine. 30-45 minutes late in an hour and fifteen minute class. Ridiculous. By that point, I’m in the middle of class, holding a pose, and the student who just walked in is asking me to move. Totally throws me off. </p>

<p>How’s your day been? Feeling fall? And what’s your biggest pet peeve?</p>

	<div class="date">

	</div>

	<p>Being off routine is hard. And I’ve been out of whack this week.</p>

<p>I flew Monday night into Baltimore. Drove to Maryland. Slept for 4 hours, and then woke up to interview a bunch of awesome students. The campus was gorgeous</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/uJv3RlnS1it3oYHYZRGTuHXcscFOxEIGOYvROXTec00=w707-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>I finally felt like I was experiencing fall.</p>

<p>Then I flew back Wednesday and had a lot of work waiting for me. I’ve basically been holed up at my desk and home until today when I helped with the company Halloween party.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/QUkuFwp9oNoOEC8oRpm1-2Cq3_dG5zhct5toSqgO1Jo=w1038-h607-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Now I’m putting together a last minute zombie costume. (Oh god)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ypQXQHDhJQYLsLtzWVWDVwrOjl0KtjKilkOpygokiQ0=w501-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Mixing up some fake blood as we speak. </p>

<p>What are your weekend plans? Halloween parties anyone?</p>

	<h1><a href="/11-3-2014/halloween-ugly.html">Halloween Weekend, the ugly and the not so ugly.</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		November 3, 2014
	</div>

	<p>I’ve never been the type of person to have a ton of school spirit, or any type of spirit. I wasn’t the kid who dressed up for football games, or Halloween, or events or conventions. I don’t begrudge those who do, on the contrary. I’m a little jealous. I wish I could put something amazing together for every holiday, and pull it off. </p>

<p>Fortunately, J’s the same. Except, this year we had a Halloween party that we had to have costumes for. And I found this out… 2 days before. So I threw together a costume of things I had in my house.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/prZ9iCOhLt60TCYlLsDZykOuOJoIgOeQT8kFXvuMY7s=w493-h716-no" alt="K costume"></p>

<p>A white t-shirt, brown eyeshadow, lipstick, food coloring and corn syrup came together for a pretty serious zombie. Work loved it, but a few coworkers freaked out. Definitely an ugly costume, and not the traditional sexy one.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-mRxBHp7sSlM/VFPI0AcgesI/AAAAAAAAM0o/vbIcGWlQVEI/s716-no/IMG_4167-MIX.jpg" alt="K panel"></p>

<p>It worked great with J. His hazmat suit (a legit Amazon purchase) and my seriously ill zombie were couples costumes without being like, Peanut Butter and Jelly.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/wTNjCJT-fdipjaZbB_r8xjW3yY5PzMfou4rC0Qd8VGY=w598-h716-no" alt="j costume"></p>

<p>But my whole weekend wasn’t spent sitting in sticky corn syrup blood and heavy makeup.</p>

<p>I had a nail appointment with the best salon in San Francisco. Legit, I’ve tried at least 4 different salons with gels. Every single one I had cracking by the third day. And they do gel nail art. Shakira at <a href="http://sparklesanfrancisco.com/">Sparkle</a> is my fave. I seriously shell out for her every single month. That’s how long her nails last. An entire month. (If you don’t mind some grow out!)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-JoJlJYYi3fA/VFbUZ_kn3hI/AAAAAAAAM6w/jK3tqKK3tus/s716-no/IMG_4202.JPG" alt="nails"></p>

<p>The only thing as good looking as my nails, was chilling with <a href="http://almostgettingittogether.com/">Cassie</a>. We got the most beautiful beet salads ever at <a href="http://www.bluebarngourmet.com/">Blue Barn</a>. Seriously. I want to eat this every day of my life now. Forever and always.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/gJN3vD6H38xqIcN9VEz16Q3PJ7RLm131hjrrzOLcU7g=w955-h716-no" alt="salad"></p>

<p>Not to make it look like my entire Sunday was food, but between coffee and lunch we stopped at the Fort Mason Farmer’s Market. Super adorable. I bought some candied walnuts and walnut butter from a stand by <a href="http://olddogranch.com/">Old Dog Ranch</a>. The candied walnuts were just okay, but the maple walnut butter was out of this world. I got a mini jar, and thank god, because I’m literally like half way through it one day later.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/mXL7lgkbuGFTvco6wdyb8bOkVKoig4iGLEJB9goD4b8=w955-h716-no" alt="farmers market"></p>

<p>It was the coolest weekend, and I’m only sad I didn’t take more pictures! Now it’s back to work, and writing interview feedback while watching How to Get Away with Murder.</p>

<p>That said, while the start of the week sometimes sucks on the work horizon, I love using it to structure the other five days. I’m hoping to get a bunch of yoga and running in this week. Hold me to it. </p>

<p>What’re your goals for the week? </p>

	</div>

	<p>It was one of those weekends, where you end up doing so much, you want another weekend after to relax. (In a good way!) It&#39;s still in the 60s and 70s in the Bay, so I&#39;m trying to get out as much as possible before the fog rolls in.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/IC98GPe5mrTvPu2AD06dOdlpWi8aXf-62bp2IUsEOBs=w860-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>We completed the Guinness Book of World Record’s <a href="www.coolpatchpumpkins.com">longest corn maze</a>. That map. That map is the maze. We died a little inside completing it, but we conquered the corn.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-B76phZNHMalKnkbUFmnJRr2xqDROYiZ375T-ngbWQo=w1038-h522-no" alt=""></p>

<p>J really wanted a hay ride to celebrate his corn maze completion. Unfortunately there wasn’t one. So we made our own. Corn Maze - 0, Kay and friends - 1.</p>

<p><a href="www.almostgettingittogether.com">Cassie</a> and I hung out again. It was, in a word, magical. If you don’t have a friend you can sweat with, vent to, and eat delicious food with. I totally suggest finding one.</p>

<p>I took my first Surf Set class. Love at first wipe out. </p>

<p>I want to tell you all more about it (and I will later this week!), but I had to brag a little about my weekend while I’m still so pumped from it. :)</p>

<p>How was your weekend? Try anything new?</p>

	<h1><a href="/11-11-2014/cool-patch-pumpkins.html">Children of the Corn</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		November 11, 2014
	</div>

	<p>Last week a coworker told me the Guiness Book of World Record&#39;s <a href="www.coolpatchpumpkins.com">largest corn maze</a> was just an hour away from San Francisco. 60 acres of corn confusion. </p>

<p>Not one to turn down a challenge (especially a challenge that closed this weekend), J and I got a group of friends together and spent most of our Saturday getting lost.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/BclFfC7sjODxIIxS1Mt03LN4eTnV_uTFXjs14v8zY5s=w955-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-BGtLWvbujb8/VGAO92BKY_I/AAAAAAAANrY/AhewLFpUbIc/w955-h716-no/IMG_4417.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>The course is broken up into four different platforms, each of which runs you through a different type of maze. The first is made up of concentric circles, the second a square grid like pattern, the third, a squiggly leaf-like pattern, and the fourth a cross hatched mess. The map and course have numerical and alphabetical coordinates (e.g. L23) to try to find where you are on the map.</p>

<p>We ran into the maze foolish. In the beginning we decided not to use the map they gave us. However, after following the same circle over and over again, we took a different approach.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-DPXiwJ0K0I4/VF-c4nsPteI/AAAAAAAANk0/bntHV6PcFfs/w537-h716-no/IMG_4385.JPG" alt="j trying to find the top"></p>

<p>However, even after hoisting J up, we couldn&#39;t find an easy way to the first base. After some splitting up and Marco Polo, we finally made it to the first platform.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-imHjazHhu3o/VF-eMauduwI/AAAAAAAANlM/qHEOPYff8VM/w955-h716-no/IMG_4387.JPG" alt="found the first base"></p>

<p>At this point, looking at the corn field, we realized we couldn&#39;t really keep going without a map, or we&#39;d be in the maze until it closed at 10pm. So we made it a game, and promised only to look every 3 minutes.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/hf7i36-Hl__jts6BQP62B3puc0P8hNwURpykZ8Aui7A=w1038-h630-no" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-P5uIdvOJ9QA/VGLWrfeb6II/AAAAAAAAN6A/YnVTZj2YT04/w537-h716-no/findtheway.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>With this tactic we got through the next two platforms much quicker. At the third platform though, despite the smiles here, we were kind of over tramping through corn. It turns out, unlike on a hike, a corn maze doesn&#39;t look much different at any point. I had my fitbit on, and we were reaching mile 6 of walking through the maze. That&#39;s a lot of corn.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-jP-mgKj2f1c/VGAOr9mstdI/AAAAAAAANps/yPZjSsZwGQ8/w955-h716-no/IMG_4408.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>We finally made it out at this tiny wooden bridge. We were so happy to have escaped the maze. But J was disappointed, because they weren&#39;t running their hay ride.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-mo5PR3SXYV8/VGAPPdsebxI/AAAAAAAANtU/6lE5ZF28Pwk/w955-h716-no/IMG_4427.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>So the boys made their own. I was simultaneously embarrassed (because they took over a random wagon and were running around the parking lot), and pleased, because come on, it&#39;s adorable.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-fbymk21vmwY/VGAPWtJ8e_I/AAAAAAAAN2E/SyAG6rlRTKY/w1038-h522-no/IMG_4433.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>All in all the maze would have been the best ever if it was about half the length. By end we were pretty exhausted, and sick of seeing corn, and all we wanted was to pee and eat In-n-Out. Both of which we did. </p>

<p>What&#39;s the craziest (or dumbest) thing you&#39;ve done lately?</p>
