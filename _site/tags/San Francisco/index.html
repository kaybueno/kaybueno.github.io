	<p>Thanks to Jury Duty yesterday, J and I were able to play around in the city after my case was released.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-syIKbUei2UE/VNLa4nTiYmI/AAAAAAAAVUU/r1ZcT6Ds2F0/w955-h716-no/IMG_6581.JPG" alt=""><div class="caption">This was a fountain before the drought.</div></p>

<p>Despite living in the city, I don&#39;t actually work in the city most days. So I rarely catch San Francisco while it&#39;s still light out during the week.</p>

<p>Lately, I&#39;ve felt like I have a lot to do, and so it was nice to have a government imposed day off, but I&#39;m glad my case didn&#39;t end up going to trial. I don&#39;t think I could survive 2-3 weeks of a court case.</p>

<p>How&#39;s your week going? If you had a day off of work, where would you go?</p>

	<h1><a href="/2-23-2015/weekend-recap-walk-san-francisco.html">Weekend Recap - How I walked San Francisco</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		February 23, 2015
	</div>

	<p>Given the weather around the world, I feel a little guilty posting this weekend recap. My pictures will give away the temperature out in Northern California. It was around 65 degrees, and a hot 65 at that.</p>

<p>I want to tell you how beautiful it was to walk around all week, but given that everyone else I know has sidewalks covered in ice. I’ll let the pictures do the talking.</p>

<p>Saturday morning I headed down to the Embarcadero, to check out the farmers market. It’s in my opinion the best farmers market in the city, albeit a little crowded by 10 a.m. One of the big draws is the fact that they have multiple street food vendors, and so it’s a great place to come grab brunch, and some cheap, delicious fruit too.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Kzl8t_LfhtU/VOswC8bO4mI/AAAAAAAAXTk/YbpJgDyeZ0A/w1023-h767-no/IMG_7246.JPG" alt=""><div class="caption">Flowers from the farmers market</div></p>

<p>While I’m excited to have a lot of free time since J is gone for the next few weeks, I also was worried that that might manifest itself into me just hiding at home because “it’s not worth going out” or “I don’t want to eat alone” or “I don’t know what to do.” So one of my goals was to stay out of the house as much as possible. After leaving the farmers market I stopped for a tea at Starbucks (it was 8 a.m., and a little chilly for me)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-qmhguE_QIfY/VOsvvDsxz1I/AAAAAAAAXQ0/2x1UO5ksHZI/w1023-h1364-no/IMG_7231.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>I spent a lot of time walking around, perusing stores. Did you know San Francisco has a Neiman Marcus Last Call? It’s kind of like the Nordstrom’s Rack for Neiman Marcus, or the inbetween of store and outlet. It’s beautiful, has gorgeous designer gear, and ugh. I almost caved to a pair of Frye boots marked down from $430 to $185, but then I realized money doesn’t grow on trees.</p>

<p>Lunch was calling me, so I headed to Basik. Acai in San Francisco is a dangerous thing. I tried to go twice this weekend, it was sold out by noon on Sunday.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-0VyDXs7lTp4/VOswQOK8xjI/AAAAAAAAXV0/rILg88OT5eQ/s1023-no/IMG_7270.JPG" alt=""> </p>

<p>In the evening I met up with a friend to play bocce at a bar. I totally forgot that bocce is fun, and I was actually passably good at it. </p>

<p>Sunday morning I grabbed brunch with friends. I was so busy chatting I didn’t even remember to snap a picture. After hanging out with them for awhile, I went walking again. I actually ended up walking over 23 miles between Saturday and Sunday.</p>

<p>After a lot of walking, I was really feeling a smoothie, so I stopped at <a href="http://earthbar.com/">Earth Bar</a> and grabbed their Miami Beach. It was really light and refreshing, it’s made of Pineapple, Papaya, Banana, &amp; Coconut Water, so it was a nice way to rehydrate. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/P2HYvmPzZ4KdyfjCUjyERmw7zlu-WTul8ArTWJS4i_E0=w1023-h1364-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Later in the evening, I met up with <a href="http://almostgettingittogether.com/">Cassie</a> for my first ever SoulCycle class, found out I can sweat even more than I thought I could, and ate a great homemade dinner (thanks girl). </p>

<p>After a weekend like that, I don’t really want to go to work today. :)</p>

<p>How was your weekend? Did you try anything new?</p>

	<h1><a href="/2-25-2015/WIAW.html">WIAW - Vegan before a Cleanse</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		February 25, 2015
	</div>

	<p>Between you and me, I’ve never done a juice cleanse before. I like eating, and I’m not always a fan of how juice cleanses are marketed. I think my liver does a fine job of getting rid of toxins, and I’m not sure I really need to detox anything.</p>

<p>But, I have wanted to try one, with a juice bar on every corner in SF, it’s hard to not wonder. And I don’t think my metabolism, and body are so fragile that 3 days of 1200 calories in juice will hurt much.</p>

<p>Cleanses are kind of expensive (even with the deal I used), and so I wanted to do it “right”. So this whole week I’ve been eating vegan, and getting progressively more restrictive with my diet. The makers suggest “you cut out alcohol, processed foods, excess salt, white flour and bread products, and refined sugar a day or two before the program and load up on fresh fruits and veggies.”</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Bpl8pAQtyQDPfkk6Eo-5t-sw0yZp_tCq13IGK3yMLkYo=s1023-no" alt=""></p>

<p>For breakfast I made some coconut chia seed pudding (coconut milk, chia seeds, a drop of agave), and sprinkled a bit of this granola on for crunch. Delicious.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-9U7954KSTq8/VO3mJkm1N7I/AAAAAAAAXfg/uOvZMDLg2A8/w1022-h767-no/IMG_7300.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Lazy lunch. A veggie sandwich with spinach, onion, tomato, avocado and mustard. And a tofu and tomato soup. I’m lucky that work labels all their vegan options, but man, it’s kind of difficult to find things that don’t feel like sides. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-fAteehmqwSU/VO3mKEjiZXI/AAAAAAAAXfg/G9zLuilI6_k/w1023-h767-no/IMG_7299.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Post lunch snack of coconut chips, and hot tea. I’ve been drinking a lot of herbal tea during this in order to cut down my carbonated beverages problem.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/FqGghkNq0zOSvryeynP5uWPEqfR8jNBAv4VJ4qdKTb6N=w1023-h1165-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Desk picture of these super delicious bean chips. They’re very reminiscent of doritos, complete with seasoning that ends up all over your hands. I really loved them.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bqsfjeWsL9gNhpQY6FzR_ExSJ8KkRjMnsLUqg7_vs6Mp=w1023-h994-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Black bean brownie bites I made from <a href="http://minimalistbaker.com/vegan-gluten-free-black-bean-brownies/">this recipe</a> but with coconut sugar instead of raw cane. I added the sprinkles when photographing otherwise they look like bean hockey pucks. They’re good, but they definitely taste “healthy”. Whenever people tell me their friends can’t tell the difference, I always wonder if they have really polite, or really healthy friends. I’d eat these at home, but I wouldn’t bring them to a party.</p>

<p>Unpictured are the handful of cashews I snarfed. I had a hard time with vegan food this time. I’m used to a lot of protein, and I think not having easy options for protein made me ravenous and freezing cold all day. I paired a small dish of the chia seed pudding with a brownie this morning for breakfast and feel much better. So I&#39;m just aiming to eat more beans, nuts and tofu today.</p>

<p>It’s fun to try vegan, especially while J isn’t around. </p>

<p>Have you tried a cleanse? What vegan food should I try out?</p>
