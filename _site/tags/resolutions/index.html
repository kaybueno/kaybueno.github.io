	<h1><a href="/1-1-2015/resolutions.html">Marking the New Year with New Goals</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		January 1, 2015
	</div>

	<p>Happy New Year! I’ve been busy spending time with family and friends, but wanted to get back to blogging for the kickoff of 2015.</p>

<p>Even J made it out here to spend time in Chicago. :)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-c9ngGjnnnw8/VKVnKn01UVI/AAAAAAAAShI/eaFTzZ8myE0/w955-h716-no/IMG_5819.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>A lot of people aren’t fans of resolutions. Gyms fill up for a few weeks. No one wants to go out to eat. Everyone’s telling you what they’ll do differently this year from last year from the year before that.</p>

<p>But I love resolutions. I adore planning, and after working on a team that does quarterly planning, and weekly check ins. I don’t think you can accurately capture all the things you want to do without written goals.  </p>

<h2><strong>Fitness:</strong></h2>

<p><strong>10 pushups.</strong> This is so pathetic. But. I remember easily pumping out push ups in school, and now I can barely handle one.</p>

<p><strong>1 pull up.</strong> Such a stretch goal. I will literally throw a party, a physical party, if I can do a pull up unassisted.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-m2mOoRn1tSI/VGrZn8m2nlI/AAAAAAAAO3c/cS96NlCK_jQ/w477-h716-no/bazu-3697090.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>The splits.</strong> I offered all the members of my family 100 dollars if they could do one at any point by the end of 2015.</p>

<p>There are notoriously no running goals in here, because I have a few events planned, and I’m not really stressing right now about my speed.</p>

<h2>Blog:</h2>

<p><strong>Blog more regularly.</strong> Perhaps with a schedule. Right now I’m kinda just doing whatever I want. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Zr8h4rbF_K8/VGBHjDUlpQI/AAAAAAAAN1w/pv4jcBm7KZY/w955-h716-no/IMG_4454.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>Hit up more bloggers in real life.</strong> I love the bloggers I’ve met, and I’d only like to meet more. I tend to travel a good bit during the year, and having gone to a small college, I never have people to meet up in popular cities. </p>

<h2>Life:</h2>

<p><strong>Get ready for bed every night at 11 pm.</strong> This doesn’t mean go to bed at 11, this means, get ready for bed at 11.</p>

<p><strong>Cook once a month.</strong> (I know, hella pathetic) But! Work basically dictates that I never have to cook. But I’m worried if I ever leave the comfort of a large tech company, I’ll be living off Chipotle and toast (not entirely a bad thing)</p>

<p><strong>Put down the screens ~30 minutes before bed.</strong> I’m so attached to my computer, phone, tablet, etc, that I need to spend 30 minutes knitting, reading a book, or just cuddling up before sleeping.</p>

<h2>Friends:</h2>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-MnM_PJe9Q5M/U9p-RxnW4EI/AAAAAAAABHs/_uCH0cN8HnI/w480-h640-no/IMG_0204.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>Write letters!</strong> I just got some really adorable wax and wax stamps as a gift from my mother for Christmas. I’d like to keep in touch with more people, and write and send physical letters. That said, if you ever want some real mail. Email me so I can send some! (I know. Ironic) </p>

<p><strong>Keep in touch better with friends from home.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Take a girls’ trip.</strong> I have spent a lot of time traveling and vacationing with J. And while I want to keep doing that, I want to do at least one girls’ vacay this year.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-zoB25pts1Ik/VEMCBYO1OKI/AAAAAAAAMCY/bel2wDqnmB8/w955-h716-no/IMG_3922.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>I’d go with anyone if we ended up here. :)</p>

<p>More than making goals, I believe checking in on goals is important. So I’ve put 3 month check-ins on my calendar (March 29, June 28, Sept 27, and Dec 31), to let you and myself know how I’m progressing.</p>

<p>How do you feel about resolutions? What are your goals for this year? </p>
