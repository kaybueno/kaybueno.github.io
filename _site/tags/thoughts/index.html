	</div>

	<p>Random things I’m thinking about lately.</p>

<h2>1. Challenges</h2>

<p>The year is ending, and I feel like it’s one of those seasons where I start thinking: “I should improve myself!”. I’m not sure if I want to take on a sleep goal, or shoot for weight loss, or train for something, or get more flexible or… And the problem is, I kind of want to do them all. I think it’s a mix of boredom and anticipating New Years and Holidays.  </p>

<p>Obviously evidenced by the picture below, I could use some biceps -- guns. :)  </p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/sn_nBR0goVOg0bxhTzcZSdsve_BmdAB4QoG2y0_LagM=w599-h716-no" alt="Kay “no-guns” Bueno"></p>

<h2>2.  Blogging induced baking urges.</h2>

<p>I made some mediocre pancakes last night. Pumpkin protein pancakes to be specific. (Yeah, I know, we’re over pumpkin. We just saw our 8th pumpkin muffin this week. But guys, I want to be on the bandwagon too) I mean, to be real with you, I haven’t been cooking much until this whole blog thing. But now that I see it everywhere. I have the urge to put things on my stove, and in my microwave, </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/6lgZSvc31SlwHc649e4-AerNhItKJDhf4Jze_n_2BiA=s716-no" alt=""></p>

<h2>3.  Christmas gifts</h2>

<p>So I have two siblings, an “adopted” sibling, my parents, my grandparents, my best friend, a handful of other friends, and my siblings’ and parent’s significant others. It’s unromantic and definitely not whimsical, but I’m going to need to make a spreadsheet soon of what I’m getting everyone. Christmas is in 40 days (or so) and that’s mind blowing.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/hsuwM_SUhJitksA4yRESqYGd8PWK5xZqzwu9yVFKEb4=w537-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Christmas last year, we all get themed pajamas every year!</p>

<h2>4.  What should I be drinking</h2>

<p>I saw a lot of people drinking the celestial seasons holiday teas. And I thought, I want some of that. So I bought it. J is making fun of me because he only drinks tea that’s leaves. Secret. I probably drink a little too much diet soda, but, I gave it up for a year, and didn’t notice a difference, so I’m back on it. I figure sugar cookie tea can’t be that much worse for you than diet rootbeer.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s J and I drinking tea in the summer. It was pretty good despite the long face.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-eEuKlkrzgIY/U-mST_5CtCI/AAAAAAAAG4E/MhWQ70rz6Oc/w537-h716-no/IMG_2672.JPG" alt="J and I with teas"></p>

<p>I snuck a cup this morning. Unsurprisingly it was pretty good. Even J admitted it wasn’t that overpowering.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-GMawJhQ3Dxw/VGZBcK_DE_I/AAAAAAAAOIs/xHZqeRrfl4o/w537-h716-no/IMG_4518.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>What&#39;s on your mind lately? Are you the type of person who makes resolutions? What do you drink at night? Help a woman out. :)</p>

	<p>This whole week I’ve felt under the weather. I’m pretty sure this is what happens when you start feeding your body actual nutrients after a two week diet of sugar and alcohol. </p>

<p>I’ve been taking it easy, a lot of my coworkers have been out sick, and I&#39;d hate to make it worse. But my body really did me in this time, because while I was chilling at home in a shark onesie, trying to figure out what my stomach would consider eating.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-popriW-o1rA/VH6hu6tBwzI/AAAAAAAATGw/KcQDZigrIpQ/w537-h716-no/IMG_5015.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>My boyfriend was meeting Chris Hemsworth (who he keeps adorably referring to as Liam.) I got this Snapchat as I was laying on the couch, wishing I could surgically remove my intestines.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/NqGzdOomSihcELoqn6MQiptlK2A76QbaXMU5n4aA2V1U=w403-h715-no" alt=""></p>

<p>I’m feeling better today, but that’s not the point! I could have been there if it wasn&#39;t for my scumbag stomach. :)</p>

<p>I saw this candle on someone’s blog this week (sorry I forgot who, my memory is terrible). And because I’m an impulsive child, I bought it Thursday night. </p>

<p>I saw this candle on someone’s blog this week (sorry I forgot who, my memory is terrible). And because I’m an impulsive child, I bought it Thursday night. </p>

<p>Big surprise. It smells like cotton candy, or just straight up sugar, or some saccharine sweet smell you know immediately. And while it’s not the candle I’ll use to seduce my boyfriend into a romantic night (unless your boyfriend loves candy, then this IS your candle), it’s a fun scent to have burning.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/WsK-aKJupQyVZ-mLUWnAQTNBMrcdR3EtpWQYopftPZAt=w781-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>And while I’m not usually a food candle person, I’m glad I grabbed this baby at Target. For 10 dollars we can make my house smell like all the best parts of a carnival. :)</p>

<p>Finally, I took this picture covertly at work of our fruit situation. Is it just me, or does fruit seem more legit when it still has the leaves on it? I keep picking the mandarins that look like they’re still growing on a tree somewhere.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/u_tS1bNtXP4S3y8B1bQmBr5NSX4SoAu3B-QIxoG_xcD6=w1041-h713-no" alt=""></p>

<p>I hoard like 3 of those puppies a day. Don’t judge.</p>

<p>Anyhow! I&#39;m off skiing this weekend. This is the second time in my life ever, and J&#39;s like 3409803945 time. He was an instructor for a brief period of time, so I try to use him for lessons to save money. :)</p>

<p>What are you up to this weekend?</p>

	<p>Fridays are always sweeter when you have a 3 day weekend after them. </p>

<p>With a little extra time, J and I wanted to get out of the city for at least one night, so we&#39;re driving to Napa to get in a long bike ride and some wine tastings. Even Napa’s highways have bike lanes, so it’s one of my favorite places to cycle.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/mwTcYvm7wjyj05_r2VTcfiOMwnnCfTiFDYGHXuUYJfIu=w955-h716-no" alt="wine">
<div class="caption">Great outdoor patio, but we went because the winery looked casual enough for bikes.</div></p>

<p>New Year, New You, and all that. But New Year, New Vacations is where I’m at this week. I’ve been trying to make light plans to see family, friends, and get in some more great hikes. I might try to convince J to go to Utah again. But we’re leaning toward southeast Asia this year.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ypMSawCEbHHza4bUyWGJ4Nbaf-AqUC6OyvhlMEctTqtb=w955-h716-no" alt="making plans">
<div class="caption">Zion is the best National Park. Sorry.</div></p>

<p>My sister gifted me a grinder and some fancy coffee, so lately I’ve been trying to class it up and use a french press. If nothing else, it makes me feel way better about my morning. Also, I’m slowly collecting all the mugs I can. It’s probably my worst impulse purchase. At this moment, my apartment has more mugs than plates. Oops!</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/q4b4zynlcno6AE-BDNg-6L-1Pem_IjFuW_hZ4BrL-KYs=w704-h716-no" alt="good coffee"></p>

<p>I really need to make an appointment to get my lashes done again. When I saw this picture in my feed, it reminded me of why I do it. </p>

<p>Not affiliated with them or anything, but as the laziest person ever. I book literally every beauty appointment on <a href="www.styleseat.com">Style Seat</a>. It&#39;s nice to keep my hair, eyelashes, and manicure appointments all in one place. And since I’m the worst at calling places, this is arguably my favorite start-up.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/jCI-vPiOtyoxn7DRHK-3yC-zcrdeC6I1a29DOztUC3S8=s716-no" alt="eyelashes">
<div class="caption">Best appointment ever, I sleep for two hours and wake up to lashes like this.</div></p>

<p>I finally booked a hotel for SeaWheeze. I’m staying at the Pan Pacific with the madre. Last year, I left this until the last minute and I was a wreck. Everything was like 600 dollars a night if you wanted to be anywhere within walking distance to the race. I finally discovered a <a href="http://ocanadahouse.com/">bed and breakfast</a>, which I’d strongly recommend, mom and I loved it. </p>

<p>But this year, I got an earlier start, and a great deal on <a href="www.hotwire.com">Hotwire</a>, which puts us much closer to the starting line, and more importantly the showcase store. :) </p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-1luNQ70MoaM/VGrZutEVkmI/AAAAAAAAO5Q/iWZhd64aB2M/w955-h716-no/seawheeze.JPG" alt="seawheeze">
<div class="caption">I&#39;m mentally preparing for this madness again. :) </div></p>

<p>What are you looking forward to this weekend? Have you ever used Hotwire before? Honestly, it scared me a little not knowing what hotel you&#39;ll get when you book, but it was also kind of thrilling to find out.</p>
