	<p>Sorry for the lack of updates. Between Seawheeze, and coming back to a lot of work. I haven&#39;t really had time to update. </p>

<p>Seawheeze was amazing, I loved every minute of it. But I can&#39;t lie, the reason I originally signed up for the half, was to get a crack at the showcase store. You see, Lululemon puts out a bunch of limited edition merchandise for the race, and getting one of a kind yoga pants was basically my dream come true. But, honestly, I felt kind of guilty just flying out for new clothes. So I signed up, and trained (a little less than I should have) for a half marathon.</p>

<p>This is my re-telling of the showcase store. Fair warning, this is pretty much the reason I decided to run this race, so I have some serious bias.</p>

<p>My mom also came out for the weekend to cheer me on, and she&#39;s pretty much down for everything, so when I told her about the store, she was all set to wake up at 4:30 am and head over. It was an early morning, but we got into a very nice corralled line at 4:45 am. At this point there was still a lot of space, approximately 40-50 people in line total, with chairs and blankets everywhere. We brought a blanket, spread out, chatted with people next to us, and chilled until 6 am. Despite it still being dark out, everyone was amazingly friendly, and I met so many great people. It made me feel less like a crazy person knowing others were up at 4 am too. :)</p>

<p>I have to say, getting there right before 5 was clutch, because at 5:00 am, the line started to really heat up. The whole queue probably doubled to about 100, if not 150 people by 5 or 5:15. </p>

<p>At around 6:30, the line was all the way around the convention center. (I know because I had to pee. My suggestion, hop into the Fairmont hotel near by. Almost all the guests are runners, and honestly, we all looked alike.) But when I came back Lululemon had hired had all these cute characters, who were walking around, chatting with the line. Sorry for the potato quality of my photos, my iphone and lack of sleep combined didn&#39;t help.</p>

<p>While waiting, my mom and I heard horror stories from other people in line about how in previous years, there was no limit, so the goal was to grab everything in your size. So originally, we planned to divide and conquer, just grabbing everything we could find in both sizes. The doors started opening at 7 am. And they had a volunteer/worker at the door clicking down the amount of people they let in each wave. Fortunately, we were the first group in, and everything was set up beautifully. Each area had little balloons marking the size of that area. So we abandoned our grab each other everything, ran to our respective sizes, and started grabbing stuff.</p>

<p>My suggestions here. Take everything you think you might want. Duffel bags went within the first group. Know your sizes, because it can be hard to grab product after people have ravaged it. But ultimately, have fun. This felt like the best shopping spree ever. I was like a little kid in a candy store. After we grabbed all the things we wanted, we heaped them down in a pile and started sorting our top 15. We came to our choices pretty quickly. Tried a few things on for size (mostly scuba hoodies and coats) and checked out. The process was easy, flawless, and we were on our way in about 20 minutes.</p>

<p>Later that afternoon, I talked to some girls at the wonderful B&amp;B we stayed at. They arrived to the store after a run at around 7, and waited in line for over 2 hours, and a lot of stuff was sold out. While they thought our morning sounded crazy, personally, as an early riser, waking up two hours earlier than them, and waiting for the same amount of time, seemed worth the amazing stuff we got. Overall my haul looked like:</p>

<p>I really focused on the rainbow swirled pattern, and the graphic dark lines for the pants. I plan on taking some more individual images of different pieces later this week. The showcase store was an amazing experience, and was coordinated so well. It was a great way to meet other runners, and a really exciting start to the weekend. My mom and I both maxed out our 15 pieces, and I&#39;ve really loved the stuff I got. </p>

<p>Race recap soon!</p>
