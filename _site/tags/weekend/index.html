	<p>A week or two ago we had a completely open day. The weather&#39;s been great, and so we wanted to get outdoors and try a new trail, stretch our legs out a bit from a long week of screens, screens and more screens.</p>

<p>So the boyfriend and I hit up Cataract Falls. When we got there it was chilly. Like, when you live in California, sometimes you forget how cold it can get. We planned the hike around a 6 mile loop that promised coastal views and ended at Cataract Falls. The coastal bit, honestly, was just so boring. Basically no elevation change, gentle weather, and mediocre views. It would have been just as good to walk on a track, or in a mall, god.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-l-G2xUF9wVI/U02toZo_udI/AAAAAAAAAQM/SmToLc4_m9I/w955-h716-no/14+-+20" alt="Alt text"></p>

<p>Five miles through, and with way too much energy left, we made it to the falls area. Not tired, we decided to tack on an extra 5 mile loop to the hike to get to the base of the waterfall and back. </p>

<p>So we took off, running down the falls trail, jumping down stairs, speedng through straight paths. I had that nagging feeling you get in the back of your mind, &quot;Hmmm, this seems like a lot of downhill.&quot; But, like an idiot, I ignored the fact that I was basically hurtling my body down a mountain.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-jj7eWdlnkg0/U02toc6YQcI/AAAAAAAAAQo/yzTdVWoy93Y/w537-h716-no/14+-+16" alt="Alt text"></p>

<p>The water was gorgeous, and made up for our lack luster hike. But fuck man, we had to climb all the way back up. 1,400 feet elevation to scale, basically 140 floors to tackle. Initially, I was dying, and expected to vomit, curl up and die (I think my boyfriend was embarrassed of me at this point. Haha). But after the first few &quot;flights&quot; of steps, my body just stopped caring.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, it sucked the whole way up. I was a disgusting sweaty mess. But I stopped taking breaks and just pushed through the bulk of it. I felt pretty bad ass. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-BZk_KutFwlo/U02toXyfGyI/AAAAAAAAAMQ/1jaox2je8G0/w955-h716-no/14+-+25" alt="Alt te"></p>

<p>We got to the top and thought we were basically done with the loop, but we still had a mile and a half to go. Longest mile and a half of our lives, we were cold, tired, and our quads were ready to fall off. When we got to the car, all I wanted to do was sit, forever.</p>

<p>We ended up ordering in and just chilling, accomplishing nothing more than a super steep 10 mile hike that day. </p>

	<p>When you’re not living near your mom, but all your friends are booked for mothers day, it’s a sweet time to go away. J (the boyfriend) and I decided to head up a few hours north to Lake Tahoe to get active. We weren’t traveling in style by any means. We stayed in a sleazy, but incredibly cheap motel. Despite kind of being a baby about these things, I have to admit, it wasn’t actually that bad. It barely cost us anything. And though the room smelled of stale smoke, and our blankets were a little thin and ripped, we barely spent any time here, and the cost cutting was worth it.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ALSpo8GhuWg/U3G6BswcjqI/AAAAAAAABAc/yCWLKuDD7_s/w1059-h706-no/kitt-jon-emerald-bay-2.jpg" alt="K &amp; J at Emerald Bay"></p>

<p>We wanted to do a bunch with our weekend away. We expected a big hike and some kayaking. It was supposed to rain day one, but it was only a 20% chance, so we decided to risk our giant hike on the first day.</p>

<p>We hit up Emerald Bay. My favorite hike so far in Tahoe. It’s a little C-shaped bay with gorgeous mountain views, rock formations, and a formidable waterfall. My advice, don’t even plan to park near the trailhead. On our way to the trail were so over-excited when we saw the top of the waterfall and the gorgeous scenery that we spent a ton of time before even getting to the trailhead to get pictures. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-7XMMRnZaJz0/U3G54uBbo0I/AAAAAAAAA_0/_GgdAPETEYA/w1059-h706-no/kitt-emerald-bay.jpg" alt="Kitt at Emerald Bay"></p>

<p>We started the descent from the parking lot to the trailhead around 1pm, and took even more time to play around photographing the waterfall that was half a mile away. Despite a disappointing winter, there’s still enough snow melting to sport a raging falls. Armed with a new camera, and a lot of energy from morning caffeine, we spent an hour playing around with shots in the falls.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-8FrHiYUeBPU/U3G5ptYPomI/AAAAAAAAA-Y/u5EXIuhmAn4/w1059-h706-no/artsy-waterfall.jpg" alt="Waterfalls!">

<p>The day was beautiful, it was a brisk but sunny 50 degrees. We started on what we planned to be a 12 mile hike, out to the next state park (D L Bliss) and back. Emerald Bay is beautiful, you see amazing coastal views, hike a slightly variated trail, and enjoy the mountains and the bay. It’s not a hard trail by any stretch, just long and a little windy.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-1E5SI_WcDXc/U3G-1CLYXgI/AAAAAAAABBc/pJtpDINsxqM/w896-h672-no/laketahoecollage.png" alt="Collage of all my pictures !"></p>

<p>A few miles in, the sky started to drop these tiny balls of snow. It was like being showered with little dippin’ dots. We thought this was adorable, and funny. J and I figured, it’s better than rain. The little ice balls just bounced off us as we walked. Note to self, if it starts precipitating, don’t continue.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ZRAe8SbZ74I/U3G_Tc2YPVI/AAAAAAAABB4/hUXa0Y1tXlk/w504-h672-no/2014-05-10+16.16.14.jpg" alt="J in snow"></p>

<p>We got to the half-way point, 6 miles in, and snow started just pouring from the sky. It was so thick, you could barely see a few feet in front of you. Armed with only hoodies and athletic pants we trekked back. It was adventurous and stupid. We became walking snowmen, with snow sticking to our hair and cotton clothes. At some points it was like hiking through a snow globe and at other points we felt like we were stuck in the arctic.  The last mile, my body was wet with a miserable mix of sweat and snow. But looking back on it, despite the cold and the snow, it was worth it. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ZaVky7eMOKI/U3G_T3_8wiI/AAAAAAAABB8/6YjDIrkLo40/w504-h672-no/2014-05-10+16.14.23.jpg" alt="Walks in snow!"></p>

<p>But of course, as soon as we got to the car (and brushed all the snow off of it). The sky cleared up, and the day went back to 50 degrees. At least we didn’t get snowed on day 2. :)</p>

	<p>Our second day in Lake Tahoe, we didn’t want to kill ourselves with another hike, especially since we were snowed on the day before. Buuuuut, we both wanted to see balancing rock before we left.</p>

<p>We considered a few activities, kayaking, paddle boarding, zip lining, all the watersports were closed until Memorial Day. I really, really didn’t want to zipline. I thought it’d be super boring, since we did it in Costa Rica. But I caved in, and let J book it. We ended up getting a two for one deal though, and hell, I like coupons. :)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-MF3Q5JJ772c/U3G58nAFtFI/AAAAAAAABAA/wM2F13TCXSY/w1059-h706-no/kitt-glamour-rock.jpg" alt="!"></p>

<p>J’s knees hurt, and it didn’t look like the gate to balancing rock was open. So we parked in a little outlet nearby. OMG. Best decision ever. It was like less than half a mile to the site. We ran around and took pictures. Since the rock entrance was closed, we were the only people there. Which made for a quiet morning.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-U05o7E1MZaQ/U3G59ZWoQ7I/AAAAAAAABAE/mtXwFnpk--0/w1059-h706-no/kitt-holding-rock.jpg" alt="!"></p>

<p>When you’re at balancing rock though, it almost feels like it could fall on you. It didn’t, but it feeeeels like it could.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-9qpPDSp4cHA/U3G5yQN2ExI/AAAAAAAAA_M/1FmU55iCiUM/w1059-h706-no/jon-holding-rock.jpg" alt="!"></p>

<p>Speaking of things falling, I’m the clumsiest person ever. I totally bit it and fell hard on my hands and knees walking back to the car. At the time, it didn’t seem like a big deal, you know? I just fell. I’m an adult. I should be able to handle it. But as we got on the road, I realized that I was bleeding through my yoga pants. We picked up some bandaids and alcohol wipes and cleaned up before getting to the high ropes course.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-i3orpttFHkk/U3WlqtTCPYI/AAAAAAAABDs/x5iwFnu546A/w504-h672-no/2014-05-11+13.42.47.jpg" alt="!"></p>

<p>Dude. It was insane.</p>

<p>Let me first point out that we were the only childless adults at the facility. But once we got past that, it was so cool. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-F_vh07mAtTA/U3WlrlNLctI/AAAAAAAABDU/fxL5zrvrpx4/s672-no/2014-05-11+15.11.44.jpg" alt="!"></p>

<p>Basically, they rigged up 5 different levels of treetop courses. They all involved some level of balancing, climbing, jumping, and zip lining. You would clip in and climb up a ladder, onto a platform, have to tightrope across to the next platform, and then skateboard in mid-air into a weirdly woven web that you climb across to a zipline. And repeat with a billion different challenges.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-vfE1FnLv0nI/U3WlqBLu4UI/AAAAAAAABDE/arS7FNkUljk/s672-no/2014-05-11+14.32.30+HDR.jpg" alt="!"></p>

<p>We did every single one of them. It was crazy fun. This was also the Sunday of Mother’s Day, so there were a lot of moms there. I felt really bad at some points because a lot of the moms, despite being in decent to good shape, were really afraid of failing at the courses, so they didn’t even try.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-2V7j8TJf0EM/U3WlrE5onqI/AAAAAAAABD4/awH9-tJZTIY/w896-h672-no/2014-05-11+13.56.19.jpg" alt="!"></p>

<p>To be fair though, it was hard. The next day I was so sore, I wanted to puke.</p>

	<p>When I was little, my family used to go apple picking every fall. We’d ride the hay ride, pick more apples than we would ever eat, and buy a dozen apple donuts. I now realize this tradition was more for getting to binge on apple donuts than a love of picking apples.</p>

<p>This last weekend, J and I went to go relive my childhood by picking Olallieberries (a cross between a bunch of berries, most notably the blackberry) from a small farm down highway 1.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-QPtW6iX8xO0/U-K1s5_qJiI/AAAAAAAAFZA/wTdZn39DjvI/w955-h716-no/IMG_2094.JPG" alt="Kay picks berries yo"></p>

<p>We were (are?) like children. (And of course, we were the only people there without children, go figure.) We ran around trying to pick all the “best” berries. J kept telling me we had enough, we had too many berries, we would never eat this many. And I was pretty sure I could finish all of the berries in the car ride home. (Spoiler alert: I did not eat all the berries on the way home.) </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-OIZ9vwBLmzs/U-KwwXP8vyI/AAAAAAAAFWI/a3nQdR0jkzA/w955-h716-no/IMG_2082.JPG" alt="Serious berry haul"></p>

<p>After our serious berry haul, we made our way to Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park. A mouthful of a name, if you ask me. We started aimlessly walking around because we couldn’t find a map, and then ran into an ultra marathon trail run group, who were on their 35th mile. I then felt a little guilty about my long runs being 6 miles.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/CBgpwsm27tnbWLWhgB8PO8XYpIv5oOCh9jBQLqHBGXc=w578-h716-no" alt="But for real, it’s beautiful"></p>

<p>Since we had no destination, we eventually hit a river that cut off our path. The ultramarathoners were unreal amazing and just ran through the waist deep water like it was nothing. However. I was unprepared, so J and I scrambled across the rocks to get to the other side. Success! Our shoes only got a little wet, and I didn’t fall in. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-dyp46wIbqfo/U-K2YQrQBzI/AAAAAAAAFeQ/f4SlRyv4ukI/w537-h716-no/IMG_2122.JPG" alt="This is a river"></p>

<p>Ultimately, after crossing the river, we came upon a bunch of dead animals in the woods, and that seemed like a good sign to turn around, so we did. We hopped back in the car, drove home, and ate all the rest of the berries.</p>

<p>Should have picked more.</p>

	<p>This summer our vacations have been beautifully formulaic. We choose a place a few hours out from San Francisco. Book a shitty motel in the area. Then hike, bike, and eat the local food.</p>

<p>Since day one in SF, J has been wanting to go to Shasta. So bam! We did. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-5IiGWdT2Upg/U-K9vta2UkI/AAAAAAAAGOQ/DAkb-vXkHRE/w537-h716-no/IMG_2442.JPG" alt="We made it!"></p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-gGut2AlXKqI/U-K8JvIqWlI/AAAAAAAAGFo/i4soP8Met8U/w537-h716-no/IMG_2393.JPG" alt="Rocks!"></p>

<p>Because we are nowhere near cool enough, we decided not to actually hike Shasta itself. Mostly since we wanted to spend our time just looking at it. And also because, it takes like a whole day, and it was 108 degrees outside. So hot.</p>

<p>We ended up at Castle Crags, a pretty sweet hike. We started from a parking area, and climbed. Since we believed the things we read on the internet, we hear this was going to be a 5 mile hike, total. Unfortunately, since we never looked at a map, we didn’t realize that it was 5 miles to the top, and 5 back down. Oops.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Ec8vG2XtRLxBrsHopGNMB6vn09VLzOxqTkPV25TtZ5I=w1062-h682-no" alt=""></p>

<p>The hike had about 2000 ft elevation gain over a 5 mile windy path. And then the last 500 feet was a lot of scrambling up rocks. Which I pretty much hate the most ever. I always feel, regardless of how much actual safety there is, that I’m going to fall down. So after a few minutes of scrambling, I told J to go ahead, and I’d wait. I was tired, it was hot, we were running out of water. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Y8PdFkfn1xo/U-K9gaSGoaI/AAAAAAAAGMw/aAIbmjvNGvE/w403-h716-no/IMG_2431.JPG" alt="J summits crags. Balla’."></p>

<p>He made it to the top, it was amazing and beautiful, and I’m still glad I didn’t go.</p>

<p>Fortunately, on the way down, we stopped at this small, .2 mile hike to Indian Springs. Where there was potable water! I have never been so happy in the world ever for potable water. It was beautiful and amazing, and the best thing ever. We drank a lot of spring water, and then ran down the mountain for 5 miles. </p>

<p>I took a shower that flooded the entire bathroom. But I must say, a crappy motel bed and threadbare blankets never felt so good.</p>

	<p>After a hot sweaty hike the day before. We opted to get out of the heat, and hide in the caverns of Lake Shasta, where temperatures are much much cooler. Getting to the caverns was pretty low activity, you bought a ticket, walked down to the dock, got on a boat, went across the lake, and then were bussed to the cavern. Despite being sedentary, the views were amaaazing.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-LhdmCPXMdnA/U-K-11IrUuI/AAAAAAAAGTk/lww3P8YEOVI/w955-h716-no/IMG_2480.JPG" alt="Views of Lake Shasta"></p>

<p>Inside the cavern was really amazing (granted, I haven’t really been in many caves). The guide was well rehearsed, and went by a kind of cheesy script that kept the children, and the adults with no attention span paying attention, and away from touching all the rocks. (Which is bad.)</p>

<p>Since people online make a big deal of it, we were hoping the cave might be strenuous. But it’s really mostly sight seeing. We were told it was 80 stories of stairs, but in reality, it’s 80 steps, or 8 stories, and when moving in a group, you basically take this at a snails pace.</p>

<p>The whole cave is pretty amazing, but the best part is the end, with this crazy kind of cathedral formation at the end. This was the only time the guide really paused, and so we were able to convince him to snap a quick picture.</p>

	<p>Getting things done over this long weekend. My closet has been the ultimate mess since I moved in. I bought these cheap wire storage bins to store clothes. Spoiler alert, they didn&#39;t work. So I spent today re-doing my closet/dressing area. First order of business, get a real dresser.</p>

<p>I went to Ikea, even though every time I build a piece of their furniture I promise myself I will never ever go Ikea again. But then they&#39;re so cheap and easy that I forget the building hell, and I keep coming back. </p>

<p>Final product. I still need to hang some things for more color!</p>

	<p>Growing up in the midwest, I’m not particularly accustomed to seafood outside of fish, and maybe shrimp in a cocktail. </p>

<p>So when a good friend was having her birthday at a state park, two hours north of San Francisco, where the plan was to shuck oysters. I was pumped! </p>

<p>And petrified. I’ve never taken a shell off of anything more than a hermit crab.</p>

<p>The location was beautiful. To be fair, every beach in California is beautiful, but Point Reyes really has some amazing shoreline views. J and I hiked (if you can call it that) up a short paved cliffside road to watch some surfers and enjoy the view before the other party-goers got there.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-rkS27TFvE80/VEMFAEjwjGI/AAAAAAAAMEA/6ZcpuIdQzFk/w955-h716-no/IMG_3942.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-CXTI6SwZFi8/VEMCDr4tu0I/AAAAAAAAMCk/x8hWE1_jy5s/w955-h716-no/IMG_3923.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>About 20 people came, a pretty good turn out for a seaside birthday. Unfortunately, the most familiarity anyone in the group had with shucking oysters was a few YouTube videos. </p>

<p>However, both sea otters and gulls are pretty good at getting oysters open. So we figured a few 20 somethings with knives couldn’t do too poorly.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/CcaP5WI4p5HR4fZxtbm5KyT3vd03UIZHy4wDlid00iY=w680-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>After success with the first mollusc, everyone wanted to get their hands on one.</p>

<p>We had 100 oysters, a bunch of sides, and some gorgeous picnic tables laid out by the beach. Turns out, even for a midwestener, getting oysters out of their shells isn’t very difficult, and eating them fresh with a little lemon and hot sauce is one of the best things ever. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/fPGy6Vpys5B7JjxUXCEFc6tucdn4zEmWGCRq990SbUE=w570-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Friends, sun, sand and sea were the perfect way to spend a Saturday morning.</p>

<p>How’s your weekend going? Try anything new recently?</p>

	<p>I read on Friday night that Adobe was unveiling a new mural in our neighborhood at 8 am Saturday morning. However, there was no way I was going to get J up before noon to look at one mural. (Heaviest. Sleeper. Alive.)</p>

<p>So on Sunday after brunch we stopped by to get a look.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Bfiy7YORjd5YW-u9A0-8N92C92z7vizWVNk9mjAdRs=w874-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>The goal, if I remember correctly, is to spark creative moments for passers by. The artist figures people keep their heads down and ignore their surroundings when they walk, and murals like these make you take notice of your surroundings. People were definitely noticing it when we were there, there was practically a queue waiting to snap photos.</p>

<p>The mural is in a larger “park” area, that often holds fitness classes, has super adorable coffee and juice bars, and is generally a fun place to explore. And so we did!</p>

<p>The fitness section had some serious monkey bars.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-BnsuXs5clUs/VEQhzThqV-I/AAAAAAAAMJ4/CtTdY8Oukiw/w537-h716-no/IMG_4003.JPG" alt="J on monkey bars"></p>

<p>J did them with ease. I tried, but it was a total failure. Since most monkey bars are in parks for kids, I always have the safety net of being able to put my feet down. But these were definitely designed with adults in mind. Both J and I had to seriously hop to grab. On the first bar my sweaty palms slipped right off. One day I’m going to go back with some chalk and more resolve, and try again.</p>

<p>The last installation was this bucket list inspired piece: </p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/USoJl9xSababi32xk-ViL0UZf0rWLsDmSzvHcJrhayk=w955-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/bWidfx-XZD_sw9aIhh9D-TmdIP35eMCNYrx72nYF1HY=w940-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>I loved some of the answers, like: “Do a barrel roll.” or “Kiss someone I love in the rain” or “Help beat cancer.”</p>

<p>It’s silly, but one of the more frivolous goals I have is to be able to do the splits. I didn’t put it on the board, and I’m not sure that it’s something I need to do before I die. But seeing what everyone else has on their bucket list made me think of it.</p>

<p>What’s something you want to do before you die?</p>

	<p>Today was one of those days that started with the water heater not working. Unfortunately, when you’re trying to wash your hair as infrequently as possible (for its own health!) and you’re on day four or five. You have to shower. Needless to say, my day didn’t begin on a great note.</p>

<p>It was packet pickup for Run 10 Feed 10, which is a 10k by Women’s Health that crosses the Golden Gate Bridge. I’ve only ever crossed via car, and I love trashy health magazines. So J and I walked to the running store to pick up my packet.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/5_WXeAHPHW6KLkHkd8fT4pquxQxePo8tJr32dEPlCtE=w1038-h684-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Despite the fact that it’s November, we scrambled out in tshirts because the weather here is still in the 70s. It’s crazy. Halloween is in a week.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-aWwc5m7Lyg0/VEwgXHVRWcI/AAAAAAAAMag/I7F_2koYoyI/w931-h716-no/IMG_4055.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>The Run 10 Feed 10 bag was adorable. But hilariously, I’m most excited for the temporary tattoos. I missed doing the “Run Yoga Party” spray on tattoos for Seawheeze and so I’m making up for it.</p>

<p>We ended up with another free bag for Google Shopping Express (a same day delivery service in the Bay). Their logo is a parachute, and so they sent out these adorable themed bags.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-KKPCJfw6hqQ/VEwgMsKkbII/AAAAAAAAMXo/WZ4m3CEu6QI/w537-h716-no/IMG_4049.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Reusable bags are a pretty big deal here, since it costs 10 cents to buy disposable bags at any store.</p>

<p>When we got home we had already walked a bunch around the city. So I snapchatted my family really attractive faces while J worked. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-FNcJqtnk2Lw/VEwgbE_drXI/AAAAAAAAMZU/0jfKn9dQfO4/w537-h716-no/IMG_4058.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>I’ve got dinner plans and an early bedtime waiting for me tonight. (Race starts at 7:30ish) Eugggh. </p>

<p>What’s the best swag you ever got? (I hope it’s not temporary tattoos, otherwise, we gotta talk.)</p>

	<p>Spoiler alert. I ran Run 10 Feed 10, and I was bad. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s start from the beginning though. I woke up at 6 am to get ready for this race. I had carefully prepared all the things I needed the night before. However, my morning brain couldn&#39;t remember where I put them. So I spent like half an hour freaking out and looking for them. Good going Kay.</p>

<p>I pulled myself together, and hauled myself to Crissy Field. I was pumped. The views were beautiful. There were a ton of runners. It was good. I started snapping some quick pictures from the field of the bridge.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-JLSTgjLKqvw/VE01Eoh6K5I/AAAAAAAAMdA/4GcCJDtqWNM/w955-h716-no/IMG_4068.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>I hate subtle foreshadowing, so I&#39;m going to be obvious here. The bridge looks pretty high up from where I was taking photos. I thought nothing of that at the time. The morning was beautiful, there were cute booths. I got to put on a temporary tattoo and got prizes for taking selfies (basically my dream). The world was good.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/oPjIXWqMXULk-fHw8WGbMWHrYd6C5QZ2BOtZRre4r88=s716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Women&#39;s Health put on a killer display. There were a bunch of adorable sponsor booths. We warmed up with a very calm instructor from a local yoga studio. They had tons of photographers coming around snapping pictures, making me feel like people should always be taking pictures of my pre-run festivities. </p>

<p>They lined up the runners into different pace groups. I wanted this to be a chill run, and didn&#39;t want to feel super competitive (I did this run to take pictures of the bridge!) So I put myself in the last group.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/xb6nh2Ig8Cy7LDBk8DucHLSOfwyxFFLHAYJgAwQ2AcI=w955-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>And we started! There wasn&#39;t a lot of fanfare for this. I hit the button on my cheapo Garmin, and started my playlist that I haven&#39;t updated since Seawheeze and started running. </p>

<p>The photos of the bridge, are pretty killer. And the road was blocked off, so I didn&#39;t feel overcrowded or anything.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/g6CTli4YXS60_cK1vMpZad5XyBSXcqSPX6DzwCg5Mis=w955-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-L5PVajP060w/VE01S6Jb9sI/AAAAAAAAMfA/loE2VqAxrW4/w955-h716-no/IMG_4079.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>However. This route starts with a whole lot of uphill. Annnd. Elevation and I aren&#39;t friends. Furthermore, if you know how a bridge works, it&#39;s basically sloping up and down the entire way. </p>

<p>On my recent runs, I haven&#39;t been feeling any fatigue until mile 5 or so. On this run, 2 miles in and I was gross. Sweaty, and breathing heavy, and a real mess. While they had water at the other end of the bridge, there were not enough water stations in the world to fix and hydrate me.</p>

<p>I finished the race at an embarrassing 10:30 pace. And looked something like this at the end:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-JsWryTDmHFc/VE01ZY_WriI/AAAAAAAAMf8/Ycs-CFV6urs/w537-h716-no/IMG_4090.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>I could give you the 150 excuses I have for a bad run. But it really boils down to lack of practice. </p>

<p>That said. Run 10 Feed 10 was beautiful, and amazing. And if you get the chance to run over the Golden Gate Bridge, you should DEFINITELY do it. At the end there was a delicious bagel and fruit spread, dynamic stretching (I waited 30 minutes in line for this and it was worth every second), and a great yoga session.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-QHi6BTmArYk/VE01FndeOtI/AAAAAAAAMdI/1wjQ94KrAMY/w955-h716-no/IMG_4069.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Please, tell me of your successes this weekend. I went to the Bridge School Benefit after this, and got to feel really good about my fitbit step count all day. So all in all, not bad. :)</p>

	<p>I’ve never been the type of person to have a ton of school spirit, or any type of spirit. I wasn’t the kid who dressed up for football games, or Halloween, or events or conventions. I don’t begrudge those who do, on the contrary. I’m a little jealous. I wish I could put something amazing together for every holiday, and pull it off. </p>

<p>Fortunately, J’s the same. Except, this year we had a Halloween party that we had to have costumes for. And I found this out… 2 days before. So I threw together a costume of things I had in my house.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/prZ9iCOhLt60TCYlLsDZykOuOJoIgOeQT8kFXvuMY7s=w493-h716-no" alt="K costume"></p>

<p>A white t-shirt, brown eyeshadow, lipstick, food coloring and corn syrup came together for a pretty serious zombie. Work loved it, but a few coworkers freaked out. Definitely an ugly costume, and not the traditional sexy one.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-mRxBHp7sSlM/VFPI0AcgesI/AAAAAAAAM0o/vbIcGWlQVEI/s716-no/IMG_4167-MIX.jpg" alt="K panel"></p>

<p>It worked great with J. His hazmat suit (a legit Amazon purchase) and my seriously ill zombie were couples costumes without being like, Peanut Butter and Jelly.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/wTNjCJT-fdipjaZbB_r8xjW3yY5PzMfou4rC0Qd8VGY=w598-h716-no" alt="j costume"></p>

<p>But my whole weekend wasn’t spent sitting in sticky corn syrup blood and heavy makeup.</p>

<p>I had a nail appointment with the best salon in San Francisco. Legit, I’ve tried at least 4 different salons with gels. Every single one I had cracking by the third day. And they do gel nail art. Shakira at <a href="http://sparklesanfrancisco.com/">Sparkle</a> is my fave. I seriously shell out for her every single month. That’s how long her nails last. An entire month. (If you don’t mind some grow out!)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-JoJlJYYi3fA/VFbUZ_kn3hI/AAAAAAAAM6w/jK3tqKK3tus/s716-no/IMG_4202.JPG" alt="nails"></p>

<p>The only thing as good looking as my nails, was chilling with <a href="http://almostgettingittogether.com/">Cassie</a>. We got the most beautiful beet salads ever at <a href="http://www.bluebarngourmet.com/">Blue Barn</a>. Seriously. I want to eat this every day of my life now. Forever and always.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/gJN3vD6H38xqIcN9VEz16Q3PJ7RLm131hjrrzOLcU7g=w955-h716-no" alt="salad"></p>

<p>Not to make it look like my entire Sunday was food, but between coffee and lunch we stopped at the Fort Mason Farmer’s Market. Super adorable. I bought some candied walnuts and walnut butter from a stand by <a href="http://olddogranch.com/">Old Dog Ranch</a>. The candied walnuts were just okay, but the maple walnut butter was out of this world. I got a mini jar, and thank god, because I’m literally like half way through it one day later.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/mXL7lgkbuGFTvco6wdyb8bOkVKoig4iGLEJB9goD4b8=w955-h716-no" alt="farmers market"></p>

<p>It was the coolest weekend, and I’m only sad I didn’t take more pictures! Now it’s back to work, and writing interview feedback while watching How to Get Away with Murder.</p>

<p>That said, while the start of the week sometimes sucks on the work horizon, I love using it to structure the other five days. I’m hoping to get a bunch of yoga and running in this week. Hold me to it. </p>

<p>What’re your goals for the week? </p>

	<p>It was one of those weekends, where you end up doing so much, you want another weekend after to relax. (In a good way!) It&#39;s still in the 60s and 70s in the Bay, so I&#39;m trying to get out as much as possible before the fog rolls in.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/IC98GPe5mrTvPu2AD06dOdlpWi8aXf-62bp2IUsEOBs=w860-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>We completed the Guinness Book of World Record’s <a href="www.coolpatchpumpkins.com">longest corn maze</a>. That map. That map is the maze. We died a little inside completing it, but we conquered the corn.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-B76phZNHMalKnkbUFmnJRr2xqDROYiZ375T-ngbWQo=w1038-h522-no" alt=""></p>

<p>J really wanted a hay ride to celebrate his corn maze completion. Unfortunately there wasn’t one. So we made our own. Corn Maze - 0, Kay and friends - 1.</p>

<p><a href="www.almostgettingittogether.com">Cassie</a> and I hung out again. It was, in a word, magical. If you don’t have a friend you can sweat with, vent to, and eat delicious food with. I totally suggest finding one.</p>

<p>I took my first Surf Set class. Love at first wipe out. </p>

<p>I want to tell you all more about it (and I will later this week!), but I had to brag a little about my weekend while I’m still so pumped from it. :)</p>

<p>How was your weekend? Try anything new?</p>

	<p>Last week a coworker told me the Guiness Book of World Record&#39;s <a href="www.coolpatchpumpkins.com">largest corn maze</a> was just an hour away from San Francisco. 60 acres of corn confusion. </p>

<p>Not one to turn down a challenge (especially a challenge that closed this weekend), J and I got a group of friends together and spent most of our Saturday getting lost.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-BGtLWvbujb8/VGAO92BKY_I/AAAAAAAANrY/AhewLFpUbIc/w955-h716-no/IMG_4417.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>The course is broken up into four different platforms, each of which runs you through a different type of maze. The first is made up of concentric circles, the second a square grid like pattern, the third, a squiggly leaf-like pattern, and the fourth a cross hatched mess. The map and course have numerical and alphabetical coordinates (e.g. L23) to try to find where you are on the map.</p>

<p>We ran into the maze foolish. In the beginning we decided not to use the map they gave us. However, after following the same circle over and over again, we took a different approach.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-DPXiwJ0K0I4/VF-c4nsPteI/AAAAAAAANk0/bntHV6PcFfs/w537-h716-no/IMG_4385.JPG" alt="j trying to find the top"></p>

<p>However, even after hoisting J up, we couldn&#39;t find an easy way to the first base. After some splitting up and Marco Polo, we finally made it to the first platform.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-imHjazHhu3o/VF-eMauduwI/AAAAAAAANlM/qHEOPYff8VM/w955-h716-no/IMG_4387.JPG" alt="found the first base"></p>

<p>At this point, looking at the corn field, we realized we couldn&#39;t really keep going without a map, or we&#39;d be in the maze until it closed at 10pm. So we made it a game, and promised only to look every 3 minutes.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/hf7i36-Hl__jts6BQP62B3puc0P8hNwURpykZ8Aui7A=w1038-h630-no" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-P5uIdvOJ9QA/VGLWrfeb6II/AAAAAAAAN6A/YnVTZj2YT04/w537-h716-no/findtheway.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>With this tactic we got through the next two platforms much quicker. At the third platform though, despite the smiles here, we were kind of over tramping through corn. It turns out, unlike on a hike, a corn maze doesn&#39;t look much different at any point. I had my fitbit on, and we were reaching mile 6 of walking through the maze. That&#39;s a lot of corn.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-jP-mgKj2f1c/VGAOr9mstdI/AAAAAAAANps/yPZjSsZwGQ8/w955-h716-no/IMG_4408.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>We finally made it out at this tiny wooden bridge. We were so happy to have escaped the maze. But J was disappointed, because they weren&#39;t running their hay ride.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-mo5PR3SXYV8/VGAPPdsebxI/AAAAAAAANtU/6lE5ZF28Pwk/w955-h716-no/IMG_4427.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>So the boys made their own. I was simultaneously embarrassed (because they took over a random wagon and were running around the parking lot), and pleased, because come on, it&#39;s adorable.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-fbymk21vmwY/VGAPWtJ8e_I/AAAAAAAAN2E/SyAG6rlRTKY/w1038-h522-no/IMG_4433.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>All in all the maze would have been the best ever if it was about half the length. By end we were pretty exhausted, and sick of seeing corn, and all we wanted was to pee and eat In-n-Out. Both of which we did. </p>

<p>What&#39;s the craziest (or dumbest) thing you&#39;ve done lately?</p>

	</div>
	<p>I was a kid who should have been born on the water. Every time I’ve been to the ocean, for surfing, stand-up paddle boarding, or just swimming, I’ve had a blast. Maybe even the best time of my life. Unfortunately, thanks to a midwest upbringing, skin that burns at the slightest hint of sun, and the serious cost of ocean activities, I’ve never been able to actually improve my surf skills after the initial lesson.</p>

<p>Enter Surf Set.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Hlg3axFxiPtkNIElZuHBnwmIwLrx2x6tXBrQN4Eb1jA=w1038-h657-no" alt=""></p>

<p>For those of you who haven’t heard of it before, Surf Set is pretty much like surfing on land. (A lovely experience for those of us who want to avoid burns, uncomfortable wet suits, and sharks). A surf board balanced on three, bosu-like balls, mimics the instability of the ocean. The class lets you practice both moves necessary to improve surfing, but also other non-traditional strength, cardio, and flexibility building moves.</p>

<p><a href="http://almostgettingittogether.com/surfset-review/">Cassie</a> and I went to a morning Surf Set class, at a super cute studio called <a href="http://sweatrepublicsf.com/">Sweat Republic</a>, and fell in love.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-mfYYDvf6rLY/VGAsnKEbw2I/AAAAAAAAN0E/eos1EQB8u-w/w955-h716-no/IMG_0482.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Excuse the extreme cheesing and the incorrect hand positioning. I need some more classes under my belt before I look good doing this. :)</p>

<p>The instructor was extremely friendly, and took a lot of time coming around to help correct poses, challenge students, and even help me jump from the ground onto a surfboard. It turns out she was actually a surfer, which reinforced the fact that this may actually help if I ever get on the water again.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-SlD3yMuCT2U/VGAsjSAjK8I/AAAAAAAANzI/LzGpNT_CYRM/w955-h716-no/IMG_0474.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>The class began with a quick warm up, which was primarily comprised of on the ground stretching.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-PTvGEiI4jvo/VGAsinyw29I/AAAAAAAAN0w/raeZdMXIxW0/w955-h716-no/IMG_0473.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>We worked our way through cardio, strength training, balancing, and a mock surf session in the hour long class. While I definitely sweat some, I felt it most the next day in my obliques. Balancing and stability are good for the abs. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-O9CprsRrpvU/VGAshU5weGI/AAAAAAAAN0c/EJRvwyrHyP0/w955-h716-no/IMG_0471.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>I had such an amazing time. Sometimes, when I read about classes in San Francisco, and they say “All Levels”, I interpret that as “All levels of people who are already physically fit”. </p>

<p>As someone who has a little bit of performance anxiety This class was actually “All Levels”, there are a bunch of different ways to customize both the difficulty of the boards, and the moves involved to make it work for you. The class went by super fast, and I can&#39;t wait to go again this weekend.</p>

<p>Would you surf on land? What crazy fitness class do I need to find next in San Francisco?</p>

	<p>Woah, it&#39;s already Monday. This weekend went by so fast. Here&#39;s the Spark Notes version of my life the last three days. :)</p>

<p>Friday night we fit in two shows that my boyfriend wanted to go to, they both started at 8. Fortunately, one band was the opener, and the other was the headliner.</p>

<p>So, we started with the opener, <a href="http://www.thecongressmusic.org/">The Congress</a>, one of my boyfriend’s favorite folk rock bands. </p>

<p>And then we jetted off to see <a href="http://www.hoodieallen.com/">Hoodie Allen</a>, an old, like high school old, friend of my boyfriend’s. If you haven’t heard Hoodie, I would affectionately describe his music, as white boy rap-pop.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/FiCwMkmAXxh14qJBTOKKiHQGTVkMYcbMGQq7UHQuZpQ=w637-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>The Congress was laid back, slightly buzzed 30 and 40 somethings, so we were at least 10 years younger than most of the crowd. But Hoodie Allen was mostly high school girls, the show was a lot of jumping, cake throwing, and confetti flying.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-fBdkedVh6tQ/VGmf8AZWvKI/AAAAAAAAOyQ/fXvglScu9go/w1038-h654-no/jfetti.png" alt=""></p>

<p>It was almost surreal how different the two were.</p>

<p>Saturday, J and I spent the day urban hiking. I really wanted one of the most delicious and guilty burgers that evening, and so we wanted to work off the burger in advance. We did a hilly 10 mile loop in the city.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/B7d8DuZ0Z_wo8I0doijKlIGc1whPFZ815SUOXNn3An0=w608-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>We focused mainly on Mt. Sutro open space reserve, which gave us some pretty cool views of Sutro Towers.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-wRTkYzEW9KI/VGmohKnTO2I/AAAAAAAAO0o/cWSUDJLmEHU/s716-no/sutrollage.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Sadly. Despite our serious hike. We couldn’t get reservations for burgers. So the whole hike was for nothing. Jk. We had a lot of fun.</p>

<p>Finally, Sunday I hung out with <a href="www.almostgettingittogether.com">Cassie</a> and <a href="www.instagram.com/ginamarie_hlc">Gina</a></p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-uY_VgnshJKI/VGmVwhaKeEI/AAAAAAAAOxI/TBz2YOXa-uU/w1038-h702-no/2014-11-16.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>We also rocked an urban hike in the Presidio. It went by super fast thanks to a lot of venting, wine, and really amazing grapes from the farmers’ market.
It kept me close to the ocean, so I was pretty happy</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/tNU7SDKcZBBmR2_wQoWvhIXIi68Hy_dag9xbq8fE5BQ=w569-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>J and I made up for a burgerless Saturday by indulging Sunday night instead. I would have a picture of my favorite burger in San Francisco. Unfortunately I literally could not wait to eat it. So I didn’t even sneak a picture. You’ll have to imagine it.</p>

<p>How was your weekend? Ever been to a crazy show?</p>

	<p>Crazy week everyone. I swear, once we get into the week of Thanksgiving, everything goes by so fast. Work is busy, life is busy, weekends are busy. Blogs are neglected! I’m catching up with everything, but I wanted to show off my weekend.</p>

<p>Embarrassingly, I was having so much fun this weekend that I neglected to photograph most of it. I’d like to blame my roof, dinner, and drinks drinking. But that’s unfair. Mostly I was just too busy talking or sweating to take photos. :)</p>

<p>First. I found and purchased Coconut La Croix. Fyi, for those curious, it’s definitely sweet coconut flavor, not like, sparkling coconut water. It’s delicious, and I’m depraved so I took a bunch of selfies with it.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-749YElqnPcw/VG98q0_EIWI/AAAAAAAAPFU/-L6U6vEOomU/s672-no/IMG_4779-MIX.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>I like it, and I want to make a cocktail out of it basically. It’s kind of a perfect pina colada base. </p>

<p>Saturday morning I spent picnicing on <a href="www.almostgettingittogether.com">Cassie’s</a> roof. It was amazing, filled with wine, almonds, popcorn, cheese and really really delicious crackers.</p>

<p>I skipped out for a bit and got my nails done.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Kb8g2v_QWkhoxYBV6piW6QtW-bwLtCPP45guxJANXl4=w600-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Shakira, my nail bff, is literally the best gel nails of my life.</p>

<p>I met back up with <a href="http://www.almostgettingitogether.com">Cassie</a>, <a href="http://www.instagram.com/ginamarie_hlc">Gina</a>, <a href="http://www.thehealthymaven.com">Davida</a>, and Davida’s boyfriend for dinner. We grabbed some pretty delicious Japanese food at Chotto.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/3i-e9adLTdEoaRoruobJUn8Ji-Wo1V5l2peQEG4-8O8=w640-h522-no" alt=""></p>

<p>The lighting was bad but the sushi and drinks were delicious.</p>

<p>Sunday I hit up some adorable boutiques in the city. I spent most of my day wishing my teeny tiny studio apartment had room for a card wall:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/nR6pU8SvtbgdVKxZGSKdXQcMg5bFTNeOqR8VR38CPPA=w955-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>A small child to dress in adorable clothing:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/d50zW0-o7ULW492AVl4cVNs-pEo4LVpDOH-zSZVG514=w415-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>And more room in my freezer for sweet potato soft serve:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/O9m3ae_yhlKDK6oXpQ53cL3CNOjX14aWClY4nOkZsuk=w639-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>I ended the evening with a hot yoga class that <a href="www.almostgettingittogether.com">Cassie</a> found. Fortunately, there is no photographic evidence of this because it was so hot, and I was so sweaty by end, that I’m pretty sure I looked like a wet dog. Beautiful.</p>

<p>How was your weekend? Are you feeling the holiday time crunch!?</p>

	<p>True Life: I was a total recluse over Thanksgiving week. Basically. Sorry I disappeared over the break. It wasn’t that I was doing anything particularly exotic, or time consuming. Mostly. I just wanted a week off from everything. I wanted to sit in freezing Chicago, eat food, watch my siblings play video games, and just like turn my mind off.</p>

<p>So. Here are the mindless things I did in my time away. :)</p>

<p>Walked a silly 5k.  My brother is on doctor’s orders not to run. So my sister and I hammed it up throughout the race.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-25e6aN_e9Rc/VH5hVDR6AAI/AAAAAAAAPvQ/1NRIGcak72I/w915-h610-no/race_641_photo_13793359.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Baked a ton of cookies. If you saw what I was eating this weekend, it would have been #fatfluential. (<a href="http://www.averiecooks.com/2013/10/candy-corn-and-white-chocolate-softbatch-cookies.html">This recipe</a> plus any additions is basically perfection.)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/flMf9v8IxzFiEpwkHh9KqtDf4Z3AK5zJGConm1LX_94=w915-h953-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Kitty sat this little munchkin, who’s literally a munchkin kitten. Every time I get near a cat or a dog, I get serious pet envy and end up browsing Pet Finder for a week. Bad life choices.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/PY_jvLXyUWJd4G3R8svPQy4FnGkj5QDIyjKjVqxZji0=w914-h638-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Hung with the family. Most of this time was spent in straight up sweatpants with a cookie in one hand and coffee in the other. To spare you from that picture. Here’s a snapchat from the morning’s run.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-tKYEjUKgd4k/VHpZYZPwKeI/AAAAAAAAPe8/DmOKY4zvetI/w914-h515-no/IMG_4908.PNG" alt=""></p>

<p>It was a blast. But I have to say. I missed looking at this. It’s nice to be back somewhere where the sun shines. (Even though today it is pouring in SF. Hello 3 hour commute and flooded roads.)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Ya6TK_uYbU0/VHpXdKxeE3I/AAAAAAAAPQ4/SPJSDEzye6k/s915-no/IMG_4832.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>How is your life lately? Did you cook, bake, stuff your face with anything for the holidays? </p>

	<p>When I was a little kid, I had some serious expectations of who I’d end up as as an adult. I imagined have a seriously fabulous life, like the people (or let’s be real, characters) in most of the early 2000s reality shows. While sometimes, the inner 13 year old in me is sometimes disappointed my life didn’t turn out like Laguna Beach (the 24 year old in me is not disappointed. At all.), sometimes I have a weekend that makes me feel like my life is not too far away from a faked reality tv show.</p>

<p>It started with two Christmas parties. That looked something like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-GmXXmpKXm3o/VI8QlQ0TniI/AAAAAAAAQ3I/SunxVNHcRnI/w670-h447-no/7sutcy0774.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>Or maybe this:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-tTLFJjbVXLQ/VI8QlTCj6nI/AAAAAAAAQ3A/nvcLV5UmUnQ/w670-h447-no/7sutcy0780.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>J’s party had that adorable gif making photo booth, on top of a taco bar, a slider bar, an open bar, and a cookie decorating bar. :) Full disclosure, I am a terrible, terrible gingerbread person decorator, but a wonderful gingerbread eater.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/K7uLYS7RfS_ZJG4abwW4U1DoFOcHE392q1QGYvNawrAk=w914-h502-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Unlike the celebs, this basic b wore the same outfit both nights. If I’m honest, it was even the same look both nights. I screenshotted a snap to cherish the moment. I’ll have even more crazy photobooth photos soon.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Tq_KuR-OnYgeQwCAZqzehgHFM-G7FhW1h26p1VqX0hRD=w640-h1136-no" alt=""></p>

<p>After downing cake pops, charcuterie, alcohol laden hot chocolate, and much much more. (Like, you don’t even want to know how much more). I realized I needed to get off the holiday party buzz with some serious sweating, and healthy eating. So I signed myself up for a local 5k the morning after our second holiday party.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/XDsv8bsLY-fjdA0ZJKq3rz5Gp9N1LFhLkPhs0cpyZoD1=s915-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Best idea ever. The race was a serious blast, and I completed in a pretty reasonable time for a still kind of boozy 5k. 27:50. After the run, I hopped in the car with <a href="www.almostgettingittogether.com">Cassie</a>, and we met <a href="www.instagram.com/ginamarie_hlc">Gina</a> for brunch and a stroll around the dish.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/8rvnSNVpAi_aCCUiGo9vwRauDB9PCnVYDgSnCDTKrkP7=w527-h450-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Last, but not least (and possibly most delicious). The girls and I grabbed freezes at Pressed Juicery. Their vanilla almond milk, made into a smooth frozen yogurt, is maybe the best thing I ate all weekend, even including the cake pops. </p>

<p>I literally want to eat this every day. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/cuHmOC0XapeIOLUDcurJnkAxjxQMJZZIO03y6_SUwV4g=w838-h1355-no" alt=""></p>

<p>How was your weekend? Do you have any holiday party plans? </p>

	<p>Greetings from Chicago. I’m finally home for the holidays. </p>

<p>Do you ever have really terrible ideas you don’t realize are terrible until after you’re stuck? Welcome to me, with my flight home. For some reason, I thought it was a great idea to go with the cheapest Southwest one I could find. Which meant on Saturday, I was on a plane from 2:00pm-8:30pm. Total day killer.</p>

<p>I made up for my Saturday’s transgressions by spending time with family. I did some last minute shopping, and came across this train. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-mOyMJNq6oEg/VJeI4In2bkI/AAAAAAAARvM/TGSSp70rkVM/w593-h716-no/IMG_5489.JPG" alt="kay in train"></p>

<p>I wouldn’t have even noticed the train, or sat in it, or even posted about it, if it didn’t have a very very angry sign.</p>

<p>The sign said, and I quote “CHILDREN ONLY IN SEAT. NO CLIMBING OR HANGING. DO NOT DAMAGE. VIDEO MONITORING PRESENT!!!”</p>

<p>Post shopping, all the girls in the family (and my surprisingly-jaunty-after-getting-his-intestines-removed brother.) got together to bake and decorate cookies.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-nTZomQUI-qc/VJhSN1L1XjI/AAAAAAAARw4/CoIs0vbz_EM/w896-h672-no/cookiecollage.png" alt="cookie making"></p>

<p>The women in my family have been baking cookies since I was 4. Each year we end up taking on more and more cookies varieties (fortunately, we keep adding women to the family, by love or by birth). </p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/FbiuN6F-wgkBHZsQPPWa27A9pTzo2xL_wOf69t5pEeET=w586-h716-no" alt="The cookie table"> </p>

<p>Everyone’s cookies represent their individual baking, decorating or eating style. My youngest cousin topped everything in sprinkles, I used a small star point to fill my cookies, and my grandma dipped everything in chocolate. </p>

<p>Notable cookies are the “Pokeball” sugar cookie, and the “I will kill u” star. We’re not murderers here, it’s just that my brother is very allergic to red dye, and so my sister (who has a mean hand with a piping bag) always makes a few sarcastic cookies.</p>

<p>After 5 hours of flour, sugar, butter, and love. We finally finished and took a quick photo of the gang. </p>

<p>It’s memories like these that you don’t forget. Partially because it’s so much fun, and partially because that red frosting is never coming out of the carpet.</p>

<p>What does your family do for the holidays? Do you have a “signature” cookie?</p>
