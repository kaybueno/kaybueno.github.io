	<p>Last week a coworker told me the Guiness Book of World Record&#39;s <a href="www.coolpatchpumpkins.com">largest corn maze</a> was just an hour away from San Francisco. 60 acres of corn confusion. </p>

<p>Not one to turn down a challenge (especially a challenge that closed this weekend), J and I got a group of friends together and spent most of our Saturday getting lost.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/BclFfC7sjODxIIxS1Mt03LN4eTnV_uTFXjs14v8zY5s=w955-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-BGtLWvbujb8/VGAO92BKY_I/AAAAAAAANrY/AhewLFpUbIc/w955-h716-no/IMG_4417.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>The course is broken up into four different platforms, each of which runs you through a different type of maze. The first is made up of concentric circles, the second a square grid like pattern, the third, a squiggly leaf-like pattern, and the fourth a cross hatched mess. The map and course have numerical and alphabetical coordinates (e.g. L23) to try to find where you are on the map.</p>

<p>We ran into the maze foolish. In the beginning we decided not to use the map they gave us. However, after following the same circle over and over again, we took a different approach.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-DPXiwJ0K0I4/VF-c4nsPteI/AAAAAAAANk0/bntHV6PcFfs/w537-h716-no/IMG_4385.JPG" alt="j trying to find the top"></p>

<p>However, even after hoisting J up, we couldn&#39;t find an easy way to the first base. After some splitting up and Marco Polo, we finally made it to the first platform.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-imHjazHhu3o/VF-eMauduwI/AAAAAAAANlM/qHEOPYff8VM/w955-h716-no/IMG_4387.JPG" alt="found the first base"></p>

<p>At this point, looking at the corn field, we realized we couldn&#39;t really keep going without a map, or we&#39;d be in the maze until it closed at 10pm. So we made it a game, and promised only to look every 3 minutes.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/hf7i36-Hl__jts6BQP62B3puc0P8hNwURpykZ8Aui7A=w1038-h630-no" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-P5uIdvOJ9QA/VGLWrfeb6II/AAAAAAAAN6A/YnVTZj2YT04/w537-h716-no/findtheway.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>With this tactic we got through the next two platforms much quicker. At the third platform though, despite the smiles here, we were kind of over tramping through corn. It turns out, unlike on a hike, a corn maze doesn&#39;t look much different at any point. I had my fitbit on, and we were reaching mile 6 of walking through the maze. That&#39;s a lot of corn.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-jP-mgKj2f1c/VGAOr9mstdI/AAAAAAAANps/yPZjSsZwGQ8/w955-h716-no/IMG_4408.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>We finally made it out at this tiny wooden bridge. We were so happy to have escaped the maze. But J was disappointed, because they weren&#39;t running their hay ride.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-mo5PR3SXYV8/VGAPPdsebxI/AAAAAAAANtU/6lE5ZF28Pwk/w955-h716-no/IMG_4427.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>So the boys made their own. I was simultaneously embarrassed (because they took over a random wagon and were running around the parking lot), and pleased, because come on, it&#39;s adorable.</p>

<p>All in all the maze would have been the best ever if it was about half the length. By end we were pretty exhausted, and sick of seeing corn, and all we wanted was to pee and eat In-n-Out. Both of which we did. </p>

<p>What&#39;s the craziest (or dumbest) thing you&#39;ve done lately?</p>
