	<h1><a href="/2-23-2015/weekend-recap-walk-san-francisco.html">Weekend Recap - How I walked San Francisco</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		February 23, 2015
	</div>

	<p>Given the weather around the world, I feel a little guilty posting this weekend recap. My pictures will give away the temperature out in Northern California. It was around 65 degrees, and a hot 65 at that.</p>

<p>I want to tell you how beautiful it was to walk around all week, but given that everyone else I know has sidewalks covered in ice. I’ll let the pictures do the talking.</p>

<p>Saturday morning I headed down to the Embarcadero, to check out the farmers market. It’s in my opinion the best farmers market in the city, albeit a little crowded by 10 a.m. One of the big draws is the fact that they have multiple street food vendors, and so it’s a great place to come grab brunch, and some cheap, delicious fruit too.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Kzl8t_LfhtU/VOswC8bO4mI/AAAAAAAAXTk/YbpJgDyeZ0A/w1023-h767-no/IMG_7246.JPG" alt=""><div class="caption">Flowers from the farmers market</div></p>

<p>While I’m excited to have a lot of free time since J is gone for the next few weeks, I also was worried that that might manifest itself into me just hiding at home because “it’s not worth going out” or “I don’t want to eat alone” or “I don’t know what to do.” So one of my goals was to stay out of the house as much as possible. After leaving the farmers market I stopped for a tea at Starbucks (it was 8 a.m., and a little chilly for me)</p>

<p>I spent a lot of time walking around, perusing stores. Did you know San Francisco has a Neiman Marcus Last Call? It’s kind of like the Nordstrom’s Rack for Neiman Marcus, or the inbetween of store and outlet. It’s beautiful, has gorgeous designer gear, and ugh. I almost caved to a pair of Frye boots marked down from $430 to $185, but then I realized money doesn’t grow on trees.</p>

<p>Lunch was calling me, so I headed to Basik. Acai in San Francisco is a dangerous thing. I tried to go twice this weekend, it was sold out by noon on Sunday.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-0VyDXs7lTp4/VOswQOK8xjI/AAAAAAAAXV0/rILg88OT5eQ/s1023-no/IMG_7270.JPG" alt=""> </p>

<p>In the evening I met up with a friend to play bocce at a bar. I totally forgot that bocce is fun, and I was actually passably good at it. </p>

<p>Sunday morning I grabbed brunch with friends. I was so busy chatting I didn’t even remember to snap a picture. After hanging out with them for awhile, I went walking again. I actually ended up walking over 23 miles between Saturday and Sunday.</p>

<p>After a lot of walking, I was really feeling a smoothie, so I stopped at <a href="http://earthbar.com/">Earth Bar</a> and grabbed their Miami Beach. It was really light and refreshing, it’s made of Pineapple, Papaya, Banana, &amp; Coconut Water, so it was a nice way to rehydrate. </p>

<p>Later in the evening, I met up with <a href="http://almostgettingittogether.com/">Cassie</a> for my first ever SoulCycle class, found out I can sweat even more than I thought I could, and ate a great homemade dinner (thanks girl). </p>

<p>After a weekend like that, I don’t really want to go to work today. :)</p>

<p>How was your weekend? Did you try anything new?</p>

	</div>

	<p>With J gone for a few weeks (although, I got him to change his flight and come home earlier!!!), my schedule has been a little shaken up. Normally, we wake up around 8, maybe 9, and stumble on a bus, or a bike all the way into work.</p>

<p>Lately, I’ve been waking up at 5-6 a.m., and it’s amazing. I’m in love with the early morning, and I’ve been walking to work. (partially because my bike is in the shop, partially because I prefer walking.)</p>

<p>It’s fun to shake up your schedule, and I love that walking makes me feel more energized throughout the day. This morning I snapped a bunch of pictures along my way, so you could see my morning walk.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-7CnDhwX-RRw/VPXcOBtRq3I/AAAAAAAAX0Y/XYcPVyjW5nA/s1023-no/IMG_7394.JPG" alt=""><div class="caption">A lonely Google bike left on the side of the road.</div></p>

<p>It’s a little chilly in the mornings, early to mid 40s. But it’s nothing a sweater can’t handle. (Sorry cold parts of the world.)</p>

<p>When I leave before 7 a.m., all the little kids are biking to school, and it’s adorable to see parades of kids on little, neon-colored bikes. However, I have morals, I think it’s weird to snap pictures of unassuming kids and post them on the internet.</p>

<p>This and a coffee is really the perfect way to wake up in the morning. </p>

<p>How do you wake up? Do you pass anything great on your way to work? </p>
