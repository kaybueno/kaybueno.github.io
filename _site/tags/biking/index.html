	<h1><a href="/9-23-2014/bike-haleakala.html">Hawaii Vacation Day 2 - Bike Haleakala</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		September 23, 2014
	</div>

	<p>On the second day in Hawaii we were up bright and early to do a 23 mile long bike ride down Haleakala, Maui’s volcano. We booked with <a href="http://www.bikemaui.com/">Haleakala Bike Co</a> who I would wholeheartedly recommend. Our trip included a van ride to the top, a tour around the crater, and then a long, unsupervised bike ride down. Did I mention unsupervised? (Read: J and I get bored following big groups)</p>

<p>Our guide Kemo, was a local who had ridden down the volcano’s roads by bike, skateboard, and even shopping cart. He was hilarious and personable (as every guide should be), and he should basically quit his day job because the man took the most amazing pictures of us.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-YLpt07JEWDc/VB-ogI31ggI/AAAAAAAALVU/UYlXgTuC0Mk/w1062-h708-no/IMG_0711.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>We reached the summit (by van, although there were people people biking up the mountain. My legs ached for them) and were able to get out and explore. Kemo took pictures of all the bikers under the sign, and also against the crater view.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Q7dGrbZR34g/VB-odGoPSaI/AAAAAAAALU4/kVjHq8xsJuw/w1062-h708-no/IMG_0697.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>It was nice to stretch our legs, and the tour wasn’t rushed at all. There were a bunch of people starting hikes into the crater, so much so that J and I considered returning to hike in the crater but we never ended up doing so. :(</p>

<p>Post crater tour, we headed back to where we’d hop on the bikes. You can’t bike down from the crater’s summit, because too many people have died doing it, or liability, or something. So we started a few less-steep miles down the road.</p>

<p>Kemo kept shouting to the back of the van that we were lucky, that days rarely got this clear in Maui. So J &amp; I took about half a million pictures of the landscape. From the higher points on Haleakala, you could see both sides of Maui.</p>

<p>The bike ride was amazing, but simultaneously a little frightening. Some parts of the route are twisty, steep, and have cars driving right alongside you. The brakes on the bike are incredibly sensitive, and very strong, which can lead to unintentional whiplash, but save you from a more awful fate.</p>

<p>Most people were pretty inexperienced at biking, but all turned out fine. Honestly, we did watch one of the other members of our group topple over her bike. A mix of nerves, a large tour bus driving alongside her, and a hairpin turn caused it. She was a little scratched up, but mostly embarrassed. </p>

<p>Overall, the ride was super chill. (this is definitely not a calorie burner) But since we spent a few hours out in the sun, we came back tired and chilled the whole evening.</p>

<p>What&#39;s the longest you&#39;ve biked?</p>
