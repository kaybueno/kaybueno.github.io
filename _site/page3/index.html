	<p>It’s <a href="www.peasandcrayons.com">Wednesday</a> again. And if I could describe my week in one badly taken selfie, it would probably look something like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-eWSO5bbBf7o/VFkVhg0N5_I/AAAAAAAAPAk/he_7vYRZpRs/w434-h716-no/IMG_4240.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>A lot of times, when you see WIAW, you get the most beautiful food of someone’s day. And trust me, I’m going to give you that. But I’m also going to give you my not so great food either. (Although due to the fact that I literally snarfed it up as soon as I got my hands on it, no photo evidence exists.)</p>

<p>But let’s start with the good. My morning started with Pumpkin Chia Seed Pudding. I’m really feeling chia seed pudding, and I can make it the night before, so it works great. I’ll put up a recipe as soon as my camera is here. :) </p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-FWR91pPXUDc/VGY-RMOWsQI/AAAAAAAAO_g/Pq0R5luigKo/w752-h716-no/IMG_4516.JPG" alt="Pumpkin Chia Seed Pudding"></p>

<p>The pumpkin version was… probably good if you love pumpkin. It tasted like pumpkin pie filling to me, but I realized, I’m not a huge “real pumpkin flavor” kind of girl. I want the fakey-fake pumpkin syrup taste. Ooops.</p>

<p>Lunch was amazing. Little tacos and a salad. They had chopped, roasted, delicata squash, and it was a great topper.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/hYu-mbuHrJfA-LhgQtEjyMIGVRR_WBqrbH7z3UGVKSk=w1018-h716-no" alt="tacos and salad"></p>

<p>Lately, to get myself away from my desk, I go grab a spot of froyo. This was a pear-apple blend, with sprinkles for cuteness, and marshmallows because they taste amazing cold.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-dqK7DArD4M0/VGqznuAIspI/AAAAAAAAO-k/NCkE6pPAqd8/w911-h716-no/IMG_4744.JPG" alt="froyo"></p>

<p>Mid-day snack. Some Oloves. Basically olives. They’re so good, and such adorable travel packs. I die.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-GV3cRYUf3gA/VGuEUuwjOcI/AAAAAAAAO9Q/ayN00B9Bw9o/w809-h716-no/IMG_4747.JPG" alt="Oloves"></p>

<p>Finally, a bowl of popcorn at home. Yum</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/KY8auUnHmJIrCAsopI8x_6sf_s8U3AyHr6hzi_kTiSg=w847-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>And that would be a usual day, maybe add another snack, or fruit, if I didn’t discover a giant dispenser of 61% cacao, chocolate covered almonds at work. </p>

<p>No joke, I probably ate like 30. </p>

<p>So now I have a stomach ache, a really delicious stomach ache. And I need someone to wipe my brain so that I don’t know that these beasts are less than 10 minutes away from me. :)</p>

<p>Hahaha. Just kidding about the memory wiping. They were a good treat. But definitely a little over kill on the portion control. </p>

<p>How was your week of eats? Is there some delicious delicious snack you can’t just have one of? What are you cooking lately?</p>

	<p>Brrr. It&#39;s the first cold morning in my house. I&#39;ve been dragging my little space heater around everywhere I go, and drinking tea like it&#39;s going out of style or something.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen this survey around a bunch, and I was tagged over the weekend to do it by <a href="http://sweetsandbeets.com/">Emily at Sweets and Beets</a>, her blog is super cute, you should totally check it out. </p>

<p><strong>Four Names That People Call Me (Other Than My Real Name):</strong></p>

<p>1) Hurricane. (I was not always a neat person)<br>
2) Katie (Kathryn is the full name)<br>
3) Melissa (because someone has mistaken me for my best friend)<br>
4) Jolly Green Giant (7th grade is not a good time for nick names)  </p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-YJ2uS3q-JNw/VGrsuvqmNEI/AAAAAAAAO8M/_VKLCLQYxyw/w600-h672-no/kayandmelissa.jpg" alt=""><br>
BFFs who apparently look similar from behind.</p>

<p><strong>Four Jobs I’ve Had:</strong></p>

<p>1) I was a concession, box office, clean up worker at a movie theater. There were probably 2 years of my life where I only smelled of butter.<br>
2) Waitress and Bartender at Chilis<br>
3) Sandwich maker. This was a low point in my life, the deli made such good cookies, and we could take as many as we wanted home after work.<br>
4) Software engineer. My post college job. :)  </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-g8DNnMgyyxY/VGrZtpj5WnI/AAAAAAAAO5A/O9EzAUM6eVM/w448-h672-no/cooking-class.jpeg" alt=""> </p>

<p>Hilariously, while most of my other jobs had serious food prep, this cooking was a fun trip for my software engineering work.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/zNXOvBa4U3Os7SgjV_CCEtGb3dOO8e2zKmiBi9jRQW4=w448-h543-no" alt=""></p>

<p>We made that!</p>

<p><strong>Four Movies I Have Watched More Than Once:</strong></p>

<p>1) Mean Girls. I’m terrible about watching movies… I only can think of one.  </p>

<p><strong>Four Books I’d Recommend:</strong></p>

<p>1) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cats-Cradle-Novel-Kurt-Vonnegut/dp/038533348X">Cat’s Cradle by Kurt Vonnegut</a> (Let’s get the real serious literary one out of the way)<br>
2) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bittersweet-A-Novel-Miranda-Beverly-Whittemore-ebook/dp/B00GQAOL6W">Bittersweet by Miranda Beverly-Whittemore</a><br>

2) Kirkland, Washington.<br>
3) Seville, Spain.<br>
4) San Francisco, California.  </p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-2lYD--0MSsc/VGrZ3438Y1I/AAAAAAAAO6Y/TQBNOqh1cTY/w720-h540-no/sevilla1.jpg" alt=""><br>

<p><strong>Four Places I’d Rather Be Right Now:</strong></p>

<p>1) France! (Although I’d gain 20 pounds from croissant indulgence)<br>
2) Home to Chicago. Visiting family is the best.<br>
3) Hawaii.<br>
4) Montreal! (I have old friends there.)  </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/lwaNly-k9HgJXhO7AKdr1KeXrj9zuWHYvUBWwHIL3rA=w1016-h672-no" alt=""><br>

<p><strong>Four Things I Don’t Eat:</strong></p>

<p>1) Calamari that still look like a squid<br>
2) Macaroni and Cheese<br>
3) Wafer Cookies<br>
4) Black Licorice (although I like anise. I don’t know)  </p>

<p><strong>Four Of My Favorite Foods:</strong></p>

<p>1) Brussel Sprouts<br>
2) Chocolate covered anything, but Brookstone’s Acai has a special place in my heart.<br>
3) Acai Bowls<br>
4) Hamburgers (I’m real classy guys)  </p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-TZ345zteN6E/VGrZsTBocDI/AAAAAAAAO5s/2whmQjMDgdk/w896-h672-no/coffee%2Band%2Bacai.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>Four Things I Am Looking Forward To This Year:</strong></p>

<p>1) Christmas!<br>
2) Running Seawheeze with my mom<br>
3) Going to Rugby 7s with my sister in February<br>
4) My next vacation. Alaska (I want to see the Aurora Borealis), Asia, Europe?  </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-kCDHU9n_ka0/VGrc0SZualI/AAAAAAAAO7U/sa8-24LOMow/w528-h716-no/kandsis.jpg" alt=""><br>
Good times ahead with the sister I look nothing like.</p>

<p><strong>Four Things I’m Saying:</strong> </p>

<p>1) “Oh man.”<br>
2) “Did you hear about…” (Some article I likely found on Facebook)<br>
3) “I don’t know.” (To my boyfriend who asks more questions than Who Wants to be a Millionaire ever did<br>
4) “Sounds good to me.” (Everyone at work says this.)  </p>

<p>I&#39;m terrible at choosing people to tag, there&#39;s too much pressure! So if you haven&#39;t done this yet and want to get a little bit of reflecting in. I&#39;m tagging you! (But tell me so I can check it out!)</p>

<p>What movies should I watch more than once? If it&#39;s on Netflix, bonus points. What&#39;s your favorite food lately?</p>

	<p>Woah, it&#39;s already Monday. This weekend went by so fast. Here&#39;s the Spark Notes version of my life the last three days. :)</p>

<p>Friday night we fit in two shows that my boyfriend wanted to go to, they both started at 8. Fortunately, one band was the opener, and the other was the headliner.</p>

<p>So, we started with the opener, <a href="http://www.thecongressmusic.org/">The Congress</a>, one of my boyfriend’s favorite folk rock bands. </p>

<p>And then we jetted off to see <a href="http://www.hoodieallen.com/">Hoodie Allen</a>, an old, like high school old, friend of my boyfriend’s. If you haven’t heard Hoodie, I would affectionately describe his music, as white boy rap-pop.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/FiCwMkmAXxh14qJBTOKKiHQGTVkMYcbMGQq7UHQuZpQ=w637-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>The Congress was laid back, slightly buzzed 30 and 40 somethings, so we were at least 10 years younger than most of the crowd. But Hoodie Allen was mostly high school girls, the show was a lot of jumping, cake throwing, and confetti flying.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-fBdkedVh6tQ/VGmf8AZWvKI/AAAAAAAAOyQ/fXvglScu9go/w1038-h654-no/jfetti.png" alt=""></p>

<p>It was almost surreal how different the two were.</p>

<p>Saturday, J and I spent the day urban hiking. I really wanted one of the most delicious and guilty burgers that evening, and so we wanted to work off the burger in advance. We did a hilly 10 mile loop in the city.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/B7d8DuZ0Z_wo8I0doijKlIGc1whPFZ815SUOXNn3An0=w608-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>We focused mainly on Mt. Sutro open space reserve, which gave us some pretty cool views of Sutro Towers.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-wRTkYzEW9KI/VGmohKnTO2I/AAAAAAAAO0o/cWSUDJLmEHU/s716-no/sutrollage.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Sadly. Despite our serious hike. We couldn’t get reservations for burgers. So the whole hike was for nothing. Jk. We had a lot of fun.</p>

<p>Finally, Sunday I hung out with <a href="www.almostgettingittogether.com">Cassie</a> and <a href="www.instagram.com/ginamarie_hlc">Gina</a></p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-uY_VgnshJKI/VGmVwhaKeEI/AAAAAAAAOxI/TBz2YOXa-uU/w1038-h702-no/2014-11-16.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>We also rocked an urban hike in the Presidio. It went by super fast thanks to a lot of venting, wine, and really amazing grapes from the farmers’ market.
It kept me close to the ocean, so I was pretty happy</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/tNU7SDKcZBBmR2_wQoWvhIXIi68Hy_dag9xbq8fE5BQ=w569-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>J and I made up for a burgerless Saturday by indulging Sunday night instead. I would have a picture of my favorite burger in San Francisco. Unfortunately I literally could not wait to eat it. So I didn’t even sneak a picture. You’ll have to imagine it.</p>

<p>How was your weekend? Ever been to a crazy show?</p>

	<p>Random things I’m thinking about lately.</p>

<h2>1. Challenges</h2>

<p>The year is ending, and I feel like it’s one of those seasons where I start thinking: “I should improve myself!”. I’m not sure if I want to take on a sleep goal, or shoot for weight loss, or train for something, or get more flexible or… And the problem is, I kind of want to do them all. I think it’s a mix of boredom and anticipating New Years and Holidays.  </p>

<p>Obviously evidenced by the picture below, I could use some biceps -- guns. :)  </p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/sn_nBR0goVOg0bxhTzcZSdsve_BmdAB4QoG2y0_LagM=w599-h716-no" alt="Kay “no-guns” Bueno"></p>

<h2>2.  Blogging induced baking urges.</h2>

<p>I made some mediocre pancakes last night. Pumpkin protein pancakes to be specific. (Yeah, I know, we’re over pumpkin. We just saw our 8th pumpkin muffin this week. But guys, I want to be on the bandwagon too) I mean, to be real with you, I haven’t been cooking much until this whole blog thing. But now that I see it everywhere. I have the urge to put things on my stove, and in my microwave, </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/6lgZSvc31SlwHc649e4-AerNhItKJDhf4Jze_n_2BiA=s716-no" alt=""></p>

<h2>3.  Christmas gifts</h2>

<p>So I have two siblings, an “adopted” sibling, my parents, my grandparents, my best friend, a handful of other friends, and my siblings’ and parent’s significant others. It’s unromantic and definitely not whimsical, but I’m going to need to make a spreadsheet soon of what I’m getting everyone. Christmas is in 40 days (or so) and that’s mind blowing.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/hsuwM_SUhJitksA4yRESqYGd8PWK5xZqzwu9yVFKEb4=w537-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Christmas last year, we all get themed pajamas every year!</p>

<h2>4.  What should I be drinking</h2>

<p>I saw a lot of people drinking the celestial seasons holiday teas. And I thought, I want some of that. So I bought it. J is making fun of me because he only drinks tea that’s leaves. Secret. I probably drink a little too much diet soda, but, I gave it up for a year, and didn’t notice a difference, so I’m back on it. I figure sugar cookie tea can’t be that much worse for you than diet rootbeer.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s J and I drinking tea in the summer. It was pretty good despite the long face.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-eEuKlkrzgIY/U-mST_5CtCI/AAAAAAAAG4E/MhWQ70rz6Oc/w537-h716-no/IMG_2672.JPG" alt="J and I with teas"></p>

<p>I snuck a cup this morning. Unsurprisingly it was pretty good. Even J admitted it wasn’t that overpowering.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-GMawJhQ3Dxw/VGZBcK_DE_I/AAAAAAAAOIs/xHZqeRrfl4o/w537-h716-no/IMG_4518.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>What&#39;s on your mind lately? Are you the type of person who makes resolutions? What do you drink at night? Help a woman out. :)</p>
