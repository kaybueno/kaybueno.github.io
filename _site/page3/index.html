	<p>I wasn’t one of those amazing people who only indulged a little over Thanksgiving break. I wasn’t even one of those amazing people who only indulged over Thanksgiving. When I went home, it was serious sugar coma, food party, every single day. And it was amazing.</p>

<p>I made, and ate a bunch of <a href="http://www.averiecooks.com/2013/10/candy-corn-and-white-chocolate-softbatch-cookies.html">these</a> cookies.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/JX0-DdzwpBC0TUVK9XTWfPyipt7LmKqmY4jLAiPdnJY=w955-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>But by the last day I was pretty beat. I was feeling pretty sluggish, sleepy, and fat. So I’ve been trying to tighten up my weekly eats to balance out all my dirty habits. (Also, full disclosure, my brother is proposing to his girlfriend, there’s gonna be a wedding. I want to look good in the photos next year!)</p>

<p>So here&#39;s what I ate <a href="http://peasandcrayons.com/2014/12/ate-wednesday-202.html">Wednesday</a>.</p>

<p>Breakfast was this mondo cup of coffee, (necessary), some hardboiled eggs (which look very very plain in a white bowl), and a pink lady apple. I love and hate this breakfast. Love the way it makes me feel, hate that it’s sooooo boring.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-q0fBdeIzN70/VH9yoHZ94FI/AAAAAAAAP1c/qM_4eLabwOc/w985-h716-no/IMG_5020.JPG" alt="Breakfast"></p>

<p>Lunch salad. Pretty normal. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/z-8ImxGxIRsYXrsTsshHWFmmqk5qTaRiohGBUcf6VDE=w915-h686-no" alt="Salad"></p>

<p>Fancy soup. This was…. carrot ginger I think. I’ve been eating a bunch of soup. My bad.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-CfDZuFSp9As/VH6hYcBRnuI/AAAAAAAAP00/_OVAV2SniFw/w955-h716-no/IMG_4994.JPG" alt="Soup"></p>

<p>My drink of choice lately. Hint fizz. This stuff, this is the best cold drink lately (peppermint tea being the best hot drink.) If you’re in the Bay Area, or really anywhere, you should try this. It’s like, bottled spa water.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/7wCcG6ITXf499nKbPIz11yN4v8zbXzOz97efbrC8xnc=w471-h716-no" alt="hint"></p>

<p>My snack. These nuts are… meh. I want to whip up some energy bites or something this week to replace these guys. I’m just not a peanut person. Why eat peanuts when you could have cashews, almonds, or macadamia nuts? Idk man.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/30T-MAGx-KpIQevJDO3XBAnQpnG_-6sABVNvr3TBSfk=w494-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Dinner was another salad with pulled pork. But I was lazy, and talking to people so I didn’t snap a photo.</p>

<p>Unrelated to eats. But I’ve been listening to this a bunch while getting ready or working. To be frank, it’s officially because it’s my boyfriend’s band playing it. But if you like the garage rock type of sound, it’s worth a listen. Otherwise abort. Honestly. I mostly listen to pop and like maybe venture into indie when I’m feeling daring. I always feel a little more cultured when I go to a show with J, or listen to something outside my listening comfort zone.</p>

<p><iframe class='yt' src="//www.youtube.com/embed/kXxbK23WnJA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>Do you switch your food up, or do you eat the same thing every day? What are you listening to that I should listen to? (Hint, if it’s Hozier, I’m allllllready listening. :) )</p>

	<p>True Life: I was a total recluse over Thanksgiving week. Basically. Sorry I disappeared over the break. It wasn’t that I was doing anything particularly exotic, or time consuming. Mostly. I just wanted a week off from everything. I wanted to sit in freezing Chicago, eat food, watch my siblings play video games, and just like turn my mind off.</p>

<p>So. Here are the mindless things I did in my time away. :)</p>

<p>Walked a silly 5k.  My brother is on doctor’s orders not to run. So my sister and I hammed it up throughout the race.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-25e6aN_e9Rc/VH5hVDR6AAI/AAAAAAAAPvQ/1NRIGcak72I/w915-h610-no/race_641_photo_13793359.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Baked a ton of cookies. If you saw what I was eating this weekend, it would have been #fatfluential. (<a href="http://www.averiecooks.com/2013/10/candy-corn-and-white-chocolate-softbatch-cookies.html">This recipe</a> plus any additions is basically perfection.)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/flMf9v8IxzFiEpwkHh9KqtDf4Z3AK5zJGConm1LX_94=w915-h953-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Kitty sat this little munchkin, who’s literally a munchkin kitten. Every time I get near a cat or a dog, I get serious pet envy and end up browsing Pet Finder for a week. Bad life choices.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/PY_jvLXyUWJd4G3R8svPQy4FnGkj5QDIyjKjVqxZji0=w914-h638-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Hung with the family. Most of this time was spent in straight up sweatpants with a cookie in one hand and coffee in the other. To spare you from that picture. Here’s a snapchat from the morning’s run.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-tKYEjUKgd4k/VHpZYZPwKeI/AAAAAAAAPe8/DmOKY4zvetI/w914-h515-no/IMG_4908.PNG" alt=""></p>

<p>It was a blast. But I have to say. I missed looking at this. It’s nice to be back somewhere where the sun shines. (Even though today it is pouring in SF. Hello 3 hour commute and flooded roads.)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Ya6TK_uYbU0/VHpXdKxeE3I/AAAAAAAAPQ4/SPJSDEzye6k/s915-no/IMG_4832.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>How is your life lately? Did you cook, bake, stuff your face with anything for the holidays? </p>

	<p>Crazy week everyone. I swear, once we get into the week of Thanksgiving, everything goes by so fast. Work is busy, life is busy, weekends are busy. Blogs are neglected! I’m catching up with everything, but I wanted to show off my weekend.</p>

<p>Embarrassingly, I was having so much fun this weekend that I neglected to photograph most of it. I’d like to blame my roof, dinner, and drinks drinking. But that’s unfair. Mostly I was just too busy talking or sweating to take photos. :)</p>

<p>First. I found and purchased Coconut La Croix. Fyi, for those curious, it’s definitely sweet coconut flavor, not like, sparkling coconut water. It’s delicious, and I’m depraved so I took a bunch of selfies with it.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-749YElqnPcw/VG98q0_EIWI/AAAAAAAAPFU/-L6U6vEOomU/s672-no/IMG_4779-MIX.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>I like it, and I want to make a cocktail out of it basically. It’s kind of a perfect pina colada base. </p>

<p>Saturday morning I spent picnicing on <a href="www.almostgettingittogether.com">Cassie’s</a> roof. It was amazing, filled with wine, almonds, popcorn, cheese and really really delicious crackers.</p>

<p>I skipped out for a bit and got my nails done.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Kb8g2v_QWkhoxYBV6piW6QtW-bwLtCPP45guxJANXl4=w600-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Shakira, my nail bff, is literally the best gel nails of my life.</p>

<p>I met back up with <a href="http://www.almostgettingitogether.com">Cassie</a>, <a href="http://www.instagram.com/ginamarie_hlc">Gina</a>, <a href="http://www.thehealthymaven.com">Davida</a>, and Davida’s boyfriend for dinner. We grabbed some pretty delicious Japanese food at Chotto.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/3i-e9adLTdEoaRoruobJUn8Ji-Wo1V5l2peQEG4-8O8=w640-h522-no" alt=""></p>

<p>The lighting was bad but the sushi and drinks were delicious.</p>

<p>Sunday I hit up some adorable boutiques in the city. I spent most of my day wishing my teeny tiny studio apartment had room for a card wall:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/nR6pU8SvtbgdVKxZGSKdXQcMg5bFTNeOqR8VR38CPPA=w955-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>A small child to dress in adorable clothing:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/d50zW0-o7ULW492AVl4cVNs-pEo4LVpDOH-zSZVG514=w415-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>And more room in my freezer for sweet potato soft serve:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/O9m3ae_yhlKDK6oXpQ53cL3CNOjX14aWClY4nOkZsuk=w639-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>I ended the evening with a hot yoga class that <a href="www.almostgettingittogether.com">Cassie</a> found. Fortunately, there is no photographic evidence of this because it was so hot, and I was so sweaty by end, that I’m pretty sure I looked like a wet dog. Beautiful.</p>

<p>How was your weekend? Are you feeling the holiday time crunch!?</p>

	<p>It’s <a href="www.peasandcrayons.com">Wednesday</a> again. And if I could describe my week in one badly taken selfie, it would probably look something like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-eWSO5bbBf7o/VFkVhg0N5_I/AAAAAAAAPAk/he_7vYRZpRs/w434-h716-no/IMG_4240.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>A lot of times, when you see WIAW, you get the most beautiful food of someone’s day. And trust me, I’m going to give you that. But I’m also going to give you my not so great food either. (Although due to the fact that I literally snarfed it up as soon as I got my hands on it, no photo evidence exists.)</p>

<p>But let’s start with the good. My morning started with Pumpkin Chia Seed Pudding. I’m really feeling chia seed pudding, and I can make it the night before, so it works great. I’ll put up a recipe as soon as my camera is here. :) </p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-FWR91pPXUDc/VGY-RMOWsQI/AAAAAAAAO_g/Pq0R5luigKo/w752-h716-no/IMG_4516.JPG" alt="Pumpkin Chia Seed Pudding"></p>

<p>The pumpkin version was… probably good if you love pumpkin. It tasted like pumpkin pie filling to me, but I realized, I’m not a huge “real pumpkin flavor” kind of girl. I want the fakey-fake pumpkin syrup taste. Ooops.</p>

<p>Lunch was amazing. Little tacos and a salad. They had chopped, roasted, delicata squash, and it was a great topper.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/hYu-mbuHrJfA-LhgQtEjyMIGVRR_WBqrbH7z3UGVKSk=w1018-h716-no" alt="tacos and salad"></p>

<p>Lately, to get myself away from my desk, I go grab a spot of froyo. This was a pear-apple blend, with sprinkles for cuteness, and marshmallows because they taste amazing cold.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-dqK7DArD4M0/VGqznuAIspI/AAAAAAAAO-k/NCkE6pPAqd8/w911-h716-no/IMG_4744.JPG" alt="froyo"></p>

<p>Mid-day snack. Some Oloves. Basically olives. They’re so good, and such adorable travel packs. I die.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-GV3cRYUf3gA/VGuEUuwjOcI/AAAAAAAAO9Q/ayN00B9Bw9o/w809-h716-no/IMG_4747.JPG" alt="Oloves"></p>

<p>Finally, a bowl of popcorn at home. Yum</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/KY8auUnHmJIrCAsopI8x_6sf_s8U3AyHr6hzi_kTiSg=w847-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>And that would be a usual day, maybe add another snack, or fruit, if I didn’t discover a giant dispenser of 61% cacao, chocolate covered almonds at work. </p>

<p>No joke, I probably ate like 30. </p>

<p>So now I have a stomach ache, a really delicious stomach ache. And I need someone to wipe my brain so that I don’t know that these beasts are less than 10 minutes away from me. :)</p>

<p>Hahaha. Just kidding about the memory wiping. They were a good treat. But definitely a little over kill on the portion control. </p>

<p>How was your week of eats? Is there some delicious delicious snack you can’t just have one of? What are you cooking lately?</p>
