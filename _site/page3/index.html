	<h1><a href="/1-22-2015/the-crash.html">The Crash</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		January 22, 2015
	</div>

	<p>On Monday, <a href="http://www.kaybueno.com/1-19-2015/MLK-day.html">I posted a sad photo of J from the emergency room</a>. This week, I’ve been in and out of urgent care, an emergency room, I’ve learned to splint toes, clean wounds, and how to nearly mummify someone in non-stick gauze.</p>

<p>But all of that pales in comparison to how the accident went down.</p>

<p>You see, J and I had plans to spend the weekend biking in Napa. Winter is the <a href="http://www.napavintners.com/harvest/life_cycle_of_a_grape.asp">pruning season</a> in Napa Valley, and so it means less tourists, cheaper hotels, and more open roads.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/JB4XVjDdXT7fWHAjDUd-tzYVws0QZWHdl7EA1quNka4R=w955-h716-no" alt=""><div class="caption">This is your boyfriend in Napa before he’s wrecked</div></p>

<p>We’ve done this route, or similar routes before. We planned for a 2 mile bike ride to the winery, and then about 25 more miles traversing the mountains nearby before we’d head back. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-f4UAxBTYovU/VL1oEb5NRqI/AAAAAAAAT_E/pcJd9aFMZKA/w794-h500-no/IMG_6207.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Though it took us awhile, we reached the top of the summit, and prepared for the fun part. Coasting downhill. J has always been more fearless than I am, so the rule is that he can go as fast as he wants, as long as he waits for me to catch up every so often. Yes, I am a baby who sometimes rides her brakes downhill.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Arg1sJDd-lI/VL1oS9w2ahI/AAAAAAAAUA8/Oy0VHiTGLDM/w955-h716-no/IMG_6217.JPG" alt="J biking"><div class="caption">We took some show-offy bike photos just minutes before eating it.</div></p>

<p>We started downhill, and after a few turns, I saw Jon waiting for me on the side of the road. I assumed he was just waiting for me to catch up, but as I got closer I noticed his bike handlebars were tangled around the frame, his face was pained, and his shirt had been completely shredded up and down the sides.</p>

<p>It turned out, he was taking the downhill at 40 mph, and didn&#39;t realize the next turn was so sharp. He started losing control, and grabbed the wrong brake, the rear brake, which made his bike fishtail. He thought he had control, but then he hit the gravel and went rolling. He told me, coincidentally, that right before he fell, he thought &quot;Wow, this is the most beautiful ride I&#39;ve ever done.&quot;</p>

<p>About a minute after the crash, a huge white SUV pulled up and asked if we were okay. He stopped for us and opened the trunk. It was full of boxes, first aid equipment, hazard clean up bags, knives, etc. I knew at this point we were either in really good hands. Or about to be murdered.</p>

<p>Turns out we were saved. The good Samaritan was a local Sheriff from the CSI division. He helped us clean up J, load our bikes into the car, and brought us to the ER. He had to duck out because he needed to get to a crime scene, but this guy pretty much saved us. If he hadn&#39;t stopped, I would have had to bike the remaining 12 miles to civilization and call an ambulance from there.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/rv4t9-sPGowcrBgexwJPczCxcFBTsqx95cOoxtRq4dnT=w955-h716-no" alt="J ER"></p>

<p>J got to the hospital, where he had many X-rays. Found out he broke his toe, and sprained his rib and shoulder. Received some serious pain killers, and was cleaned up even more. We made it out alive, and even got to eat BBQ after.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a cool story, and despite our accident, I definitely love, and want to continue biking in Napa. But for future hikes, bikes or just work outs, I think it&#39;s incredibly important to have an emergency plan. </p>

<p>There are about 100 ways this could have gone worse. If I was ahead of J. If no one stopped. If J hurt himself worse and needed immediate care. We didn&#39;t even have band-aids on us.</p>

<p>In the future, we&#39;ll definitely be carrying basic first aid supplies, I&#39;m making both of us take our phones, and we&#39;ll have to have a plan of action for getting lost.</p>

<p>What&#39;s the craziest thing that&#39;s happened to you lately? Do you have plans in case of emergencies?</p>

	<h1><a href="/1-21-2015/vegan-WIAW.html">What I ate Wednesday, Vegan Exploration!</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		January 21, 2015
	</div>

	<p><a href="http://www.kaybueno.com/1-14-2015/WIAW.html">Last week</a>, I felt like my WIAW were becoming predictable. I think if I took another picture of oatmeal, or bagged eggs, my iPhone camera was going to revolt. In order to keep my sanity, and make sure my camera roll wasn’t full up of the same pictures shot every Tuesday. I decided to try different eating styles for <a href="//www.peasandcrayons.com">WIAW</a>.</p>

<p>This Wednesday I decided to explore what it’s like to be a Vegan. Obviously, doing something for one day doesn’t produce a lot of mindblowing outcomes, and there’s no before/after. I figured it would get me out of a food rut and make me try something new. My goal was to not show you my usual week made vegan, but to try to go “all in” and pick the food I felt best fit the diet. </p>

<p>Today, I ran in late after helping bandage up J’s wounds, so I didn’t have time to grab breakfast from a cafe. It was a little hard to avoid the call of eggs and yogurt, my usual morning staples. But I found a perfectly ripe banana and some Justin’s and combined.</p>

<p>I only have the before picture, but I cut the banana in half and spread the peanut butter inside. Enough of my co-workers walked by and joked that I didn’t have a future in surgery, so you just get this:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-YHWB5kyPtD0/VL7tpPMqSxI/AAAAAAAAUTs/J9xnVuuzGYs/w600-h500-no/15%2B-%2B1" alt="banana and peanut butter"></p>

<p>One of my concerns about taking a vegan day at work was that I’d spend the day eating side dishes, and never feel full. Fortunately, I found a cafe that had quite a few solid vegan entrees. I’m terrible at deciding, so I picked two dishes, figuring I could just eat half of each.</p>

<p>I ate all of both.</p>

<p>The first was an Eggplant Caponata, Pine Nuts, and Whole Wheat Pita with Celery Salad and Mustard Seed Vinaigrette</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-2Pxn4GmtYhU/VL7JC9SWZgI/AAAAAAAAUOo/tghkRrr0y8I/w955-h716-no/IMG_6290.JPG" alt="Eggplant Caponata"></p>

<p>My other lunch portion was Kyuri Zuke, Avocado, and Shiso Flake Maki, with Yuzu &amp; Pepper Edamame. Basically, a fancy way of saying pickled cucumber and avocado sushi rolls. Before today I’d probably have told you it’s not sushi without raw fish, old me was wrong, these were delicious.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/--avHlV6xRKo/VL7yQU69NfI/AAAAAAAAUVI/ksJR4fGuG_M/w600-h500-no/15%2B-%2B1" alt="sushi"></p>

<p>I purchased a three month subscription from <a href="http://www.urthbox.com/">UrthBox</a> of healthy snacks. (Side note: I think UrthBox is good but expensive, they’ve had deals on Gilt City a lot lately) Quite a few were vegan. So I grabbed these fruit chews. </p>

<p>At first, I thought, “These aren’t much different than Starbursts!”. Then I found out, Starbursts aren’t vegan. Though some varieties appear not to have gelatin, it seems many incorporate Shellac in their confectioner’s glaze, which is derived from insects.</p>

<p>So given that, these were pretty fantastic.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-rQKxx_SyzPE/VL7sX61WhyI/AAAAAAAAUSs/Rfd8fTZpNi0/s640-no/15%2B-%2B1" alt="fruit chews"></p>

<p>J wanted to get out of the house for a little bit, so we went out and grabbed a quick dinner at a local indian fusion restaurant. They were super sweet and had tons of vegan options and substitutions. I ended up with a combo platter. Dark lighting but amazing meal.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/sWpSt-G6-5mTKl8sD_QWI1Mu-J9ZC7T8l1b39BdXYqkk=w600-h500-no" alt="dinner"></p>

<p><strong>How did I feel?</strong> </p>

<p>I definitely wasn’t hungry. Granted, I basically almost ate two lunches, but I didn’t find myself missing meat</p>

<p><strong>Could I go Vegan?</strong></p>

<p>If I had a vegan friend group, or a vegan significant other, definitely. But I am unfortunately a person who caves to social pressure and I really, really love eating non-vegan deep dish pizza with J.</p>

<p><strong>What will I keep from Veganism?</strong></p>

<p>That breakfast was amazing and I can’t believe it took me this long to make. Also, I’d be more willing to grab a vegan entree at work.</p>

<p>Are you vegan? Could you do vegan? What good vegan eats did I miss out on?</p>

	<div class="date">

	</div>

	<p>Fridays are always sweeter when you have a 3 day weekend after them. </p>

<p>With a little extra time, J and I wanted to get out of the city for at least one night, so we&#39;re driving to Napa to get in a long bike ride and some wine tastings. Even Napa’s highways have bike lanes, so it’s one of my favorite places to cycle.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/mwTcYvm7wjyj05_r2VTcfiOMwnnCfTiFDYGHXuUYJfIu=w955-h716-no" alt="wine">
<div class="caption">Great outdoor patio, but we went because the winery looked casual enough for bikes.</div></p>

<p>New Year, New You, and all that. But New Year, New Vacations is where I’m at this week. I’ve been trying to make light plans to see family, friends, and get in some more great hikes. I might try to convince J to go to Utah again. But we’re leaning toward southeast Asia this year.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ypMSawCEbHHza4bUyWGJ4Nbaf-AqUC6OyvhlMEctTqtb=w955-h716-no" alt="making plans">
<div class="caption">Zion is the best National Park. Sorry.</div></p>

<p>My sister gifted me a grinder and some fancy coffee, so lately I’ve been trying to class it up and use a french press. If nothing else, it makes me feel way better about my morning. Also, I’m slowly collecting all the mugs I can. It’s probably my worst impulse purchase. At this moment, my apartment has more mugs than plates. Oops!</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/q4b4zynlcno6AE-BDNg-6L-1Pem_IjFuW_hZ4BrL-KYs=w704-h716-no" alt="good coffee"></p>

<p>I really need to make an appointment to get my lashes done again. When I saw this picture in my feed, it reminded me of why I do it. </p>

<p>Not affiliated with them or anything, but as the laziest person ever. I book literally every beauty appointment on <a href="//www.styleseat.com">Style Seat</a>. It&#39;s nice to keep my hair, eyelashes, and manicure appointments all in one place. And since I’m the worst at calling places, this is arguably my favorite start-up.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/jCI-vPiOtyoxn7DRHK-3yC-zcrdeC6I1a29DOztUC3S8=s716-no" alt="eyelashes">
<div class="caption">Best appointment ever, I sleep for two hours and wake up to lashes like this.</div></p>

<p>I finally booked a hotel for SeaWheeze. I’m staying at the Pan Pacific with the madre. Last year, I left this until the last minute and I was a wreck. Everything was like 600 dollars a night if you wanted to be anywhere within walking distance to the race. I finally discovered a <a href="http://ocanadahouse.com/">bed and breakfast</a>, which I’d strongly recommend, mom and I loved it. </p>

<p>But this year, I got an earlier start, and a great deal on <a href="//www.hotwire.com">Hotwire</a>, which puts us much closer to the starting line, and more importantly the showcase store. :) </p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-1luNQ70MoaM/VGrZutEVkmI/AAAAAAAAO5Q/iWZhd64aB2M/w955-h716-no/seawheeze.JPG" alt="seawheeze">
<div class="caption">I&#39;m mentally preparing for this madness again. :) </div></p>

<p>What are you looking forward to this weekend? Have you ever used Hotwire before? Honestly, it scared me a little not knowing what hotel you&#39;ll get when you book, but it was also kind of thrilling to find out.</p>
