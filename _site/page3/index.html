	<h1><a href="/1-14-2015/WIAW.html">WIAW - Craving's ahoy</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		January 14, 2015
	</div>

	<p>This <a href="http://peasandcrayons.com/2015/01/ate-wednesday-208.html">Wednesday</a> was brought to you by my cravings. It was a day I ate the things I was hungry for. Which worked out pretty well overall.</p>

<p>In the next few WIAW, I think I might experiment spending a day eating other popular diets. While I like the way I eat now, I think it might be fun to shake things up in the New Year. My work offers a lot of flexibility when it comes to vegan, paleo, raw, gluten free, etc diets, and while I have the chance I should try it.</p>

<p>The day started with a pretty standard cup of steel cut oats, I added, raisins, coconut, peanut butter, and a little bit of ground flax and cinnamon. Delicious, once I stirred it all together. But needed more protein. I was ravenous by lunch!</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-aTCM_ILWK-Q/VLVKMHgp9hI/AAAAAAAATdk/waIBUaoWuS4/w955-h716-no/IMG_6045.JPG" alt="breakfast"></p>

<p>Lunch was slightly large. I had both a grilled chicken sandwich, and vegan broccoli-kale soup. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-lmH2PkbQ4qs/VLX0ajAjIJI/AAAAAAAATdM/rzSylSquBes/w973-h716-no/IMG_6053.JPG" alt="lunch"></p>

<p>I was looking forward to the chicken when I ordered it, but I have to say, this soup was the star. Packed with vegetables, and a smooth consistency, you can bet I’m ordering this guy again.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-1t3kEu1EU2U/VLX0eSO86kI/AAAAAAAATdU/VXcJ3uOR4Wo/w948-h716-no/IMG_6055.JPG" alt="lunch soup"></p>

<p>So many snacks today! I’ve been eating my weight in satsuma mandarins lately. They are delicious. I had one with a little bag of pistachios. (Small win, this is the first bag of pistachios where I’ve been able to unshell every single one!)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-j3Uf0qpReQs/VLVYFbmw8PI/AAAAAAAATd4/uFwz4jqyQFU/w955-h716-no/IMG_6049.JPG" alt="snack nuts and orange"></p>

<p>And a little square of cheese. I love cheese, and have split entire cheese plates with others before. I’m always a little sad when I realize this is the serving size.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-xWdbSCPOF9o/VLX0gc8k4II/AAAAAAAATeA/loYxSCAkuAA/w715-h716-no/IMG_6056.JPG" alt="snack cheese"></p>

<p>Old habits die hard. Also I had a really long yoga class that stretched past dinner. So when I biked home at 8 pm, I didn’t really want to do more than put a pot of popcorn on the stove.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/AGD2fVv4LCD-IpOliBHLiZ5IRirjuFlzDY-fkOidK5-o=w955-h716-no" alt="Dinner popcorn"></p>

<p>Also unpictured, a cookies and cream quest bar. But! I kind of hated this. Did I eat this wrong? It was kind of slimy and the only redeeming quality was the cookie portion of this guy. I’ve heard people microwave and broil these, does that make it better?</p>

<p>What’s the best thing you ate all day? the worst? How do you eat a quest bar (if you eat them)?</p>

	<h1><a href="/1-12-2015/aspen-glow.html">Aspen Glow, Weekend Recap</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		January 12, 2015
	</div>

	<p>It’s one of those Mondays, where I can’t believe it’s Monday already. I think it has a little something to do with the fact that I spent my entire weekend here:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-0gC_Qyb39hc/VLN6g-9adpI/AAAAAAAATXc/co52EKkcLns/w864-h531-no/IMG_6019.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Time flies a lot faster on a mountain.</p>

<p>J and I spent the weekend in Tahoe with fifteen of our friends. We rented a cabin, bought an unwieldy amount of food from Costco, and skied our hearts out. J, my ever patient boyfriend and ex-ski-instructor, spent most of his time trying to teach me how to come down a mountain without dying. </p>

<p>I mostly succeeded.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Oh_vdfMVi6c/VLHAK2kIqxI/AAAAAAAATXs/pAiXHmIMNS4/w864-h648-no/IMG_6012.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>It was my second time skiing. Even though I didn’t make it to the blue runs, (in fact, I kind of freaked out about the one I did), I had a blast. </p>

<p>While I think taking lessons from someone close to you can be a disaster, I learned really well from J, and didn’t kill him (neither death by ski crash, nor death from over critiquing my form). Which is pretty much a relationship win in my book.</p>

<p>Even with 15 people, the cabin went smoothly, we didn’t trash the place, get too drunk, and we didn’t cook all our breakfast bacon at 3 am. Which the group took as a positive sign we’re getting older. We all returned home safely, and to the most beautiful sunset I’ve seen ever.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Pj2BErvuo8c/VLN68DeKXAI/AAAAAAAATXU/4pXfZZjVViE/w863-h358-no/IMG_6039.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Today, I’m pretty much sore everywhere, and I feel really energized. Which is a pretty great excuse to spend a weekend doing something new. I’ll definitely be skiing again soon. :)</p>

<p>How was your weekend?   </p>

	<h1><a href="/1-9-2015/happenings.html">Preweekend Happenings</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		January 9, 2015
	</div>

	<p>This whole week I’ve felt under the weather. I’m pretty sure this is what happens when you start feeding your body actual nutrients after a two week diet of sugar and alcohol. </p>

<p>I’ve been taking it easy, a lot of my coworkers have been out sick, and I&#39;d hate to make it worse. But my body really did me in this time, because while I was chilling at home in a shark onesie, trying to figure out what my stomach would consider eating.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-popriW-o1rA/VH6hu6tBwzI/AAAAAAAATGw/KcQDZigrIpQ/w537-h716-no/IMG_5015.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>My boyfriend was meeting Chris Hemsworth (who he keeps adorably referring to as Liam.) I got this Snapchat as I was laying on the couch, wishing I could surgically remove my intestines.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/NqGzdOomSihcELoqn6MQiptlK2A76QbaXMU5n4aA2V1U=w403-h715-no" alt=""></p>

<p>I’m feeling better today, but that’s not the point! I could have been there if it wasn&#39;t for my scumbag stomach. :)</p>

<p>I saw this candle on someone’s blog this week (sorry I forgot who, my memory is terrible). And because I’m an impulsive child, I bought it Thursday night. </p>

<p>Big surprise. It smells like cotton candy, or just straight up sugar, or some saccharine sweet smell you know immediately. And while it’s not the candle I’ll use to seduce my boyfriend into a romantic night (unless your boyfriend loves candy, then this IS your candle), it’s a fun scent to have burning.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/WsK-aKJupQyVZ-mLUWnAQTNBMrcdR3EtpWQYopftPZAt=w781-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>And while I’m not usually a food candle person, I’m glad I grabbed this baby at Target. For 10 dollars we can make my house smell like all the best parts of a carnival. :)</p>

<p>Finally, I took this picture covertly at work of our fruit situation. Is it just me, or does fruit seem more legit when it still has the leaves on it? I keep picking the mandarins that look like they’re still growing on a tree somewhere.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/u_tS1bNtXP4S3y8B1bQmBr5NSX4SoAu3B-QIxoG_xcD6=w1041-h713-no" alt=""></p>

<p>I hoard like 3 of those puppies a day. Don’t judge.</p>

<p>Anyhow! I&#39;m off skiing this weekend. This is the second time in my life ever, and J&#39;s like 3409803945 time. He was an instructor for a brief period of time, so I try to use him for lessons to save money. :)</p>

<p>What are you up to this weekend?</p>

	<h1><a href="/1-8-2015/life-lessons.html">Allowing myself to suck</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		January 8, 2015
	</div>

	<p>Two years ago. I didn’t have any hobbies. None. Not because I was busy, or because I had just moved, but because I couldn’t stomach the fact that I might look dumb doing something. </p>

<p>I was incredibly insecure. I thought that I needed to look effortless, and attractive, and cool, all the time. And that meant not taking on anything new, because I wasn&#39;t sure I could do it perfectly. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/8IbkLAUgzB56G4c9PAqYeZOxeBnXrUFXAdN-UzBjFVIN=w794-h706-no" alt="dranks with the roomies"></p>

<p>(This is probably what I thought cool looked like.)</p>

<p>In the event I did end up out of my comfort zone, I wasn’t good at it, I’d just quit. I know, real winning attitude there. It was terrible for me, and probably worse for the people I was around. </p>

<p>And I might not have ever really tried anything if I didn’t accidentally stumble upon a hobby I loved.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Z8yQO85-AX8/VK4VSw64e0I/AAAAAAAATA0/EwLzC8jKEi8/w960-h637-no/trapeze1.jpg" alt="trapeze"></p>

<p>Flying trapeze. </p>

<p>I finally wanted to be good at something so badly, I was willing to be bad at it to do so. Flying trapeze was the greatest high (literally) I had ever had, and I was addicted. I was also terrible. I&#39;m inflexible, and tall, and altogether difficult person to catch. But it was amazing. And being bad at trapeze was the best thing that happened to me.</p>

<p>I figured, once I was a total novice at one thing. Why not make a fool of myself doing all the things I wished I could do?</p>

<p>So I started running. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/q250TjR-a9ZNhekEpN1N6TxDN3MUUNFaQ__vIcC4hwqA=w955-h716-no" alt="running"></p>

<p>And yoga.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/KIMoLaHs688VGrCvkLkCL9w6CLFj_7Sayvbhyb3OWGV7=w932-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Today. Am I the best at any of these things? </p>

<p>Not even close. I run 9-10 minute miles, I&#39;m just now able to touch the floor in a forward fold, and I&#39;m still the slowest trapeze student to pick up new tricks. I read the most amazing blogs of friends who are spin instructors, serious yogis, competitive runners, and I think &quot;Oh god, what am I doing here?&quot;</p>

<p>But even as an inflexible, kind of slow student, I&#39;m the happiest me I&#39;ve ever been. I&#39;ve stopped comparing myself to others. I&#39;m much better at celebrating achievements, and I let myself try anything.</p>

<p>With the New Year rolling around, and goals being on everyone&#39;s mind, I want to remind you that you are more than the things you&#39;re good at, and it&#39;s worth trying anything you want to do even if you fail fantastically at it. I would have never run a half, or swung tricks out of lines if I didn&#39;t allow myself to be bad at things first.</p>

<p>In the immortal words of the cartoon show Adventure Time:</p>

<p>“Dude, suckin’ at something is the first step to being sorta good at something”.</p>

<p>What do you suck at?</p>
