	<p>Things have been a little crazy here. Most notably this morning I signed both my mom and myself up for SeaWheeze 2015! Woo.</p>

<p>I was super excited for it this year.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/4WtimBfywF1VYbcARzGbXxdfiaif8Z0co0A3F0704Qk=w894-h205-no" alt=""></p>

<p>I wanted to recap my experience with Soylent so far. And hit up what I’ve loved, and what I’ve strugged with. Let me give you a week by week of how it’s been.</p>

<p><strong>Week 1</strong> - Stayed on Soylent all 5 week days. 1200 calories a day on Soylent, uncounted otherwise.</p>

<p><strong>Week 2</strong> - Horrible stressful week with only 1 day Soylent. Let’s not even talk about my eating habits. (I may or may not have gorged myself on a back of mallowcreme pumpkins.)</p>

<p><strong>Week 3</strong> - 2 days Soylent, 500 calories. 5 days muggle food with general moderation.  </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ZU9U9bjti_M/U-zkJH1cDUI/AAAAAAAAIEI/DCMplJYmIRw/w429-h416-no/IMG_2756.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>So what’s going on in my blender?</p>

<p><strong>The Good:</strong><br>
1) I’m recognizing that I have a super weird relationship with food. So when I’m drinking Soylent, it’s helping me get away from some of that. For example, when drinking an adequate amount of Soylent to the point where I’m not hungry. I get this feeling like “I deserve a snack.” Even though I am perfectly satisfied, I’m finding I reward myself with food, even though I didn’t do anything award worthy.</p>

<p>2) Soylent, when drinking it, is not unpleasant.</p>

<p>3) I get a lot more done on days with Soylent. I usually take a brief walk at lunch, clear my head. Finish work earlier, and have more time for activities in the evening.</p>

<p>4) When I drink soylent, I actively want less food days I’m not drinking soylent.  </p>

<p><strong>The Not-So-Good:</strong><br>
1) I feel like a jerk turning my team down for lunch daily, or not being able to meet up with a friend after work. I’m not ready to “out” my Soylent habits yet, so a 5 day spread wasn’t working for me.</p>

<p>2) Even though Soylent tastes great. I hate the way it smells, makes my house smell, makes me smell. It actively makes me not want to drink it, even though the taste, and general experience is great. I have this mental block before I take the first sip, where I think. Shit, this is going to be horrible.</p>

<p>3) Since meals are provided for me at work, this is actually more effort than not doing Soylent.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-uan3B8_4bp4/VAU1KjXdEkI/AAAAAAAAID4/FsGt0Lpv8Vs/w963-h716-no/IMG_3009.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>The food I&#39;ve been wanting to eat with coworkers.</p>

<p>So as you can see from my little week break down. I’m shaking it up and doing a 5:2 split. (5 days off, two days on). Which I may move up to a 4:3 split once I get back from vacationing in Hawaii next week. </p>

<p>I think the most important thing is to find a sustainable way to incorporate this into my life. Honestly, the 5 days on spread, it wasn’t fitting my lifestyle. So I’m trying a method that mimics intermittent fasting more. I’ve liked it (so far) more than fasting, because Soylent even at low calories, takes away any hunger or cravings.</p>

<p>What’s been working for you so far?</p>
