	<h1><a href="/2-12-2015/sex-kitten-salad.html">Sex Kitten Salad: an early morning time saver.</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		February 12, 2015
	</div>

	<p>By the time you read this, I’ll already be on a 6 am flight to Vegas. My sister are headed out there to visit cupcake ATMs, walk the Strip, and most importantly watch the Rugby Sevens.</p>

<p>This week has been crazy, and SFO airport is honestly one of the saddest airports when it comes to food. More than that, I’ve always been one of those people who likes waking up early in the morning, but hates doing things early in the morning. Let’s be real, when I’m up at 5 am, my first thought isn’t what gourmet breakfast I’m going to cook.</p>

<p>Which is why, I’ve been making the Sex Kitten Salad, from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Skinny-Confidential-Health-Lifestyle/dp/1624140459">The Skinny Confidential’s new book</a>. (Ask me about all the recipes I’m trying from it!) I&#39;ve been following <a href="http://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/">Lauryn Evarts</a> for an embarrasssingly long amount of time, she opened me to the world of <a href="http://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/2014/04/23/shaving-face-but-women/">shaving your face</a>, makes me want to improve my <a href="http://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/2014/06/08/traveling-essentials-ramblings/">travel essentials</a>, and keeps me envying her killer style with her <a href="http://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/2011/10/22/mini-delites-5/">mini delites</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Ri1LVFeHB1M/VNxk40JJFKI/AAAAAAAAWbM/OzUZ1Xdy-do/w933-h716-no/15%2B-%2B2" alt=""></p>

<p>This simple fruit salad is easy to customize, develops even more flavor overnight, and can be made with things you likely even have in your fridge. And with the leftovers, you can rock some of The Skinny Confidential’s, <a href="http://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/2014/10/16/busy-deal-5-chia-seed-jam/">5 second chia seed jam</a>. (In blueberry instead of raspberry, natch).</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-4ZCQ1DeG4YY/VNxk4w-2L6I/AAAAAAAAWbA/8MFc1761Ix4/w504-h672-no/15%2B-%2B6" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>Serves 1.</strong> <em>(but you should make more, because trust me, everyone’s gonna want some)</em></p>

<p><strong>Ingredients</strong><br>
1 handful of strawberries, sliced<br>
1 handful of blueberries<br>
4 hefty pineapple wedges, chopped<br>
1 kiwi, skinned and diced<br>
4 tbsp/30 g Greek yogurt<br>
2 tbsp/20 g chia seeds  </p>

<p><strong>Spices</strong><br>
Cinnamon, to taste<br>
Pumpkin pie spice, to taste<br>
Nutmeg, to taste<br>
Optional: fresh mint leaves  </p>

<p><strong>Directions</strong> <em>(So basic, I shouldn&#39;t even have to tell you.)</em><br>
Combine all ingredients in a large bowl and toss lightly. Add extra spices on top. Garnish 
with mint (optional).</p>

<p>While I layered mine parfait style, I think this would look lovely served over yogurt in a glass bowl, or laid out by fruit type on a tray for brunch.</p>

<p>It’s been a welcome change from my bagged eggs for breakfast, and I might try it with coconut cream instead of yogurt for a paleo twist.</p>

<p>What’s your speed breakfast? How do you save time in the morning?</p>

<p><em>I was sent “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Skinny-Confidential-Health-Lifestyle/dp/1624140459">The Skinny Confidential: A Babe&#39;s Sexy, Sassy Health and Lifestyle Guide”</a> but, I’ve actually been eating my weight in this salad, so all opinions are my own.</em></p>

	<h1><a href="/2-11-2015/WIAW-intuitive-eating.html">WIAW, Intuitive Eating</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		February 11, 2015
	</div>

	<p>It’s one of those weeks where <a href="//www.peasandcrayons.com">Wednesday</a> feels like Friday. Probably because I’m hopping a plane to Vegas tomorrow. Intuitive eating was the perfect eating experience to try to embody on a day where I felt like I had to micromanage every other aspect of my life.</p>

<p>While actual intuitive eating has a lot of components, and is much more than a day’s effort, I wanted to see how I would do if I just let myself eat when I decided I needed to. Each thing I ate will talk about how I felt about eating it.</p>

<p>Breakfast started a little different. I had two cranberry vegan pancakes, and decidedly non-vegan eggs. I walked to work this morning, and as someone who experiences morning hunger without even moving, I was pretty hungry when I got in.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/zEN_PEetcHlawpimCKGbyl25zvvnwTHIdq7KdfIKJzca=w955-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>How I felt: I had just walked two miles to work, I probably should have waited 15 minutes for my stomach to settle a bit more before eating to better gauge my hunger.</p>

<p>Lunch I didn’t have a lot of choice in, my coworkers and I eat together every day around noon. So even though I started feeling a little hungry at 11:30, this was the one meal I couldn’t go intuitive on.</p>

<p>We stopped at a bbq food truck, where I grabbed flank steak, whole wheat pasta with tomato and spinach, and a whole bunch of roasted broccoli.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/VFMNH3dAP9dITlQQqXHahAv7tkaMEpCj5tWtU_RvwcZi=w966-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>How I felt: I was definitely ready to eat by the time this came around, and I felt pretty nourished by this plate. </p>

<p>I had ⅓ of an apple fritter. A coworker came around with treats for his birthday, and two of my teammates and I split one. There’s no picture because I stood in a huge group, drinking coffee and celebrating a friend’s achievements. Sometimes, you can’t always snap what you ate.</p>

<p>How I felt: This was celebration food. I definitely wasn’t hungry at this point, but I didn’t indulge in an entire dessert myself, and it was the right move.</p>

<p>I grabbed another snack later in the day. Work has been stocking these bars, and they’re pretty much like healthy candy. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-MQlh0FAWbFw/VNr4O_2LOrI/AAAAAAAAWQM/Rbi3PSW_uD4/w538-h716-no/15%2B-%2B1" alt=""></p>

<p>How I felt: Honestly. I think I just grabbed one of these to have an excuse to get up from my desk. I love these, but I wasn’t hungry when I ate it.</p>

<p>I went for a run, biked home, and then J and I spent the evening cleaning. At the end of the night after a bunch of sweat, bleach, and exhaustion, I just wasn’t hungry. I grabbed a handful of See’s Hot Hearts. (These are like the best Hot Tamales I’ve ever had, and cinnamon candy is difficult for me to go overboard on.)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/p786qXmuxPlSNHPNp_prnJA4qJCz2RB_lMWUjXDS6Mf3=s716-no" alt=""><div class="caption">Please enjoy my kitchen tile, straight from the 70s.</div> </p>

<p>How I felt: I probably didn’t need these, I was mostly tired, not very hungry.</p>

<p>I think I’m better at identifying food I am hungry for, and food I’m craving than I give myself credit for. I definitely ate a bunch of sugary things today, more than I usually shoot for, but overall it wasn’t terrible.</p>

<p>I’d love to eventually transition over to a more intuitive style of eating, but right now, I do live, and like living with some food rules. So we’ll see.</p>

<p>Do you eat intuitively? What’s the best thing you ate recently?</p>

	<h1><a href="/2-10-2015/making-big-purchases.html">Making big purchases.</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		February 10, 2015
	</div>

	<p>I won’t lie, I’m someone who often employs retail therapy to make myself feel better. I love buying a box of new granola bars, or finding a cute candle or buying a new subscription box on an impulse. And, while I have a general budget, I do let myself roam pretty freely with small purchases. If I see something cute on etsy under 50 dollars, chances are, I’ll eventually buy it.</p>

<p>But when it comes to big purchases, for some reason it seems much more serious to me. I could buy ten, $10 products in a week, but one pair of $98 lululemon yoga pants makes me reconsider. Because of this, it can take me weeks to finally pull the trigger on expensive purchases.</p>

<p>When I look back to my time in San Francisco. There are two major purchases I’ve made, and today I made another. I wanted to look back and see if they were worth the weeks of deliberation I put myself through.</p>

<p>The first big ticket item I bought was my bike. J and I actually bought our bikes together. We had dreams of long scenic rides on the weekends, and fast trips throughout the city. We agonized over whether we should go road, mountain, or hybrid. We eventually both bought road bikes and it was like buying my first car all over again.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-d77wl8Ge6mg/VL1q1UftRwI/AAAAAAAAUDM/iIzCFPSZTb8/w955-h716-no/IMG_6251.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Fortunately, in terms of miles, the bikes have paid themselves off easily. I don’t own a car, and so I can either, bike, walk, or take an uber into work. Self powering my commute saves me ~12 dollars a day, and makes me more awake, alert, and happy. I love my Cannondale, and even after trying a more comfortable commuter bike, still want to stick with my baby.</p>

<p>The next year, my big purchase was my Canon EOS 7D. I had been wanting to take better pictures, and blog better pictures for awhile. I have quite a few friends who do photo walks, and always have gorgeous photos they’ve edited on Facebook. I researched for awhile to find an intermediate camera, and finally bit the bullet and bought this one.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-mO8AEUfx460/U-Kfv1qCDTI/AAAAAAAAD84/jVfuJE-dzIk/w477-h716-no/IMG_1502.PNG" alt=""><div class="caption">The only photo I took of the camera.</div></p>

<p>It takes amazing pictures, even on auto. The first day it came in J and I did a pretty serious unboxing and started taking pictures around the house. It was like Christmas Day.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-_mq-pF2JxfI/U3BPIPBSgMI/AAAAAAAAATw/jQliA7AIlGc/w477-h716-no/IMG_0003.JPG" alt=""><div class="caption">One of the first photos I took with the 7D.</div></p>

<p>However, I feel a little guilty on this one. I still don’t know how to really use my camera. And when J leaves for a month of work trips, I plan on really improving this area so that I can better utilize this baby.</p>

<p>Which brings me to today. I had a Fitbit Force for the past year, and it finally broke from all the love and miles I put on it. In the past few weeks, I’ve been surprised at how much I missed step tracking, as a traditional office worker, it’s a really strong barometer for how my activity levels have been. </p>

<p>After a lot of consideration. I purchased the <a href="https://www.fitbit.com/surge">Fitbit Surge</a>. I’m super excited about the new features, but it’s definitely taken me almost a month to get on board with buying it. It’s being delivered today, so I’ll let you know how I like it.</p>

<p><img src="https://static1.fitbit.com/simple.b-cssdisabled-jpg.h9bce7fcfed9187568cb88a34fd17d7f5.pack?items=%2Fcontent%2Fassets%2Fsurge%2Fimages%2Fgallery%2Fgallery-07.jpg" alt=""><div class="caption">I loved the orange, but went with black.</div></p>

<p>What’s the last big purchase you made? Do you think a lot of about big purchases, or small ones?</p>

	<h1><a href="/2-9-2015/food-wine-friends.html">A weekend of food, wine, and friends.</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		February 9, 2015
	</div>

	<p>This weekend, to embrace the storms in SF, J went up to Tahoe in hopes of good snow, and I stayed in the city to meet <a href="http://nuttyforlife.com/">Angela</a>, who was in visiting <a href="//www.almostgettingittogether.com">Cassie</a>. </p>

<p>While I enjoy time with J, there’s something refreshing about spending a weekend with people who want to take pictures of everything, always order a salad, and actually enjoy beets. </p>

<p>I met up with Cass and Ange at <a href="http://kinkhao.com/">Kin Khao</a>, a super cute Thai place downtown. Turns out it’s on the <a href="http://www.michelintravel.com/selections/2015-san-francisco-michelin-selections/">Michelin Recommended list</a> (always a great way to find restaurants), and it definitely lived up to its recommendation. The food was amazing, the curry was potent, and the vegetables speak for themselves.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-jH7AcjnA6W0/VNcBfwa7vQI/AAAAAAAAWCI/yKwJg6f4JeI/w537-h716-no/15%2B-%2B8" alt=""><div class="caption">I could live on Kin Khao’s brussel sprouts.</div></p>

<p>The next morning we were off to Napa. We hit up <a href="http://www.scribewinery.com/">Scribe</a>, an artisinal winery and vineyard in Sonoma, which is probably my new favorite winery of all time. If you go, you’ll fall in love with the land, the wine, and your sommelier. I know we did.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-A_4FxzUOuVU/VNjoMhjR3GI/AAAAAAAAWGA/ezjitnSQS3s/w955-h716-no/15%2B-%2B5" alt=""><div class="caption">A lot of the day looked like this.</div></p>

<p>The weather behaved and we ended up having a beautiful sunny morning at Scribe. Drinking in both the view, and the varietals, there’s so much to talk about that I have to save Scribe for it’s own post. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/UutUv1tteHVC5G9HtwWdEOBfNVafJ65bnbBtLYEIfu22=w1041-h630-no" alt="Girls at Scribe"></p>

<p>Everything on Saturday was really low key, so no one was bothered as I climbed on a bench to snap a quick photo.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-tDU3-YOL3N4/VNbyh1xEFGI/AAAAAAAAVow/-p8TXkCSKsA/w955-h716-no/IMG_6692.JPG" alt=""><div class="caption">The photo.</div></p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-fGBi3GZJBhU/VNjoMlEwAoI/AAAAAAAAWFo/ST14Znoo9iU/w537-h716-no/15%2B-%2B3" alt=""><div class="caption">The photographer.</div></p>

<p>After Scribe we hit up <a href="https://www.mummnapa.com/">Mumm</a>, known for their sparkling wine, we were excited to get our bubbly on.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/zqPzrP1YM95wtjKEFquJdL1Uu9hcYztLdI7ZM5uWVgnQ=w982-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>But after the beautiful scenery, our personable host, and the phenomenal wine at Scribe, it was hard to enjoy the cookie cutter feel of Mumm. When we heard the table next to us get the same specials speech, it felt a little dry.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-2NLsiiIoOao/VNcBfw_1OhI/AAAAAAAAWBU/ZbpUlpFOJ1o/w537-h716-no/15%2B-%2B17" alt=""></p>

<p>At least the glasses were beautiful, and fun to drink.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-58bncEjsA64/VNjoMigVM2I/AAAAAAAAWFw/Dmfr317lZ-A/w537-h716-no/15%2B-%2B4" alt=""><div class="caption">This is the photo you take after your awkward server cards you.</div></p>

<p>We went with the staff favorites tasting. While I wanted to love the sparkling pinot noir. My favorite was the DVX 2009, (second from the left).</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ADODGNNkI10/VNcBf01N0cI/AAAAAAAAWCY/1jt6UWRJFI4/w995-h716-no/15%2B-%2B16" alt=""></p>

<p>We left and grabbed the most delicious food (and another 3 cups of coffee) at <a href="http://www.longmeadowranch.com/Farmstead/Restaurant">Farmstead</a> in Napa. While I neglected to take pictures, I strongly recommend it. The beets, the salad, and the fish were off the charts.</p>

<p>On Sunday we headed to Palo Alto to grab Pressed Juicery’s Freeze. Basically, froyo made of their juice flavors. It’s one of those foods I would eat daily if it were in the city, primarily because the vanilla almond milk freeze is 40 calories. Yum.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/G4XaunxMch3WwGnfhHqHAa0pAY5Q10zh-vw4qS9cZN79=w771-h716-no" alt=""><div class="caption">The usual. Vanilla almond milk, with blueberries, coconut and almond butter.</div></p>

<p>All in all. A pretty killer weekend. </p>

<p>How was your weekend? Have you been to Napa yet?</p>
