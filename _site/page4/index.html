	<h1><a href="/1-21-2015/vegan-WIAW.html">What I ate Wednesday, Vegan Exploration!</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		January 21, 2015
	</div>

	<p><a href="http://www.kaybueno.com/1-14-2015/WIAW.html">Last week</a>, I felt like my WIAW were becoming predictable. I think if I took another picture of oatmeal, or bagged eggs, my iPhone camera was going to revolt. In order to keep my sanity, and make sure my camera roll wasn’t full up of the same pictures shot every Tuesday. I decided to try different eating styles for <a href="//www.peasandcrayons.com">WIAW</a>.</p>

<p>This Wednesday I decided to explore what it’s like to be a Vegan. Obviously, doing something for one day doesn’t produce a lot of mindblowing outcomes, and there’s no before/after. I figured it would get me out of a food rut and make me try something new. My goal was to not show you my usual week made vegan, but to try to go “all in” and pick the food I felt best fit the diet. </p>

<p>Today, I ran in late after helping bandage up J’s wounds, so I didn’t have time to grab breakfast from a cafe. It was a little hard to avoid the call of eggs and yogurt, my usual morning staples. But I found a perfectly ripe banana and some Justin’s and combined.</p>

<p>I only have the before picture, but I cut the banana in half and spread the peanut butter inside. Enough of my co-workers walked by and joked that I didn’t have a future in surgery, so you just get this:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-YHWB5kyPtD0/VL7tpPMqSxI/AAAAAAAAUTs/J9xnVuuzGYs/w600-h500-no/15%2B-%2B1" alt="banana and peanut butter"></p>

<p>One of my concerns about taking a vegan day at work was that I’d spend the day eating side dishes, and never feel full. Fortunately, I found a cafe that had quite a few solid vegan entrees. I’m terrible at deciding, so I picked two dishes, figuring I could just eat half of each.</p>

<p>I ate all of both.</p>

<p>The first was an Eggplant Caponata, Pine Nuts, and Whole Wheat Pita with Celery Salad and Mustard Seed Vinaigrette</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-2Pxn4GmtYhU/VL7JC9SWZgI/AAAAAAAAUOo/tghkRrr0y8I/w955-h716-no/IMG_6290.JPG" alt="Eggplant Caponata"></p>

<p>My other lunch portion was Kyuri Zuke, Avocado, and Shiso Flake Maki, with Yuzu &amp; Pepper Edamame. Basically, a fancy way of saying pickled cucumber and avocado sushi rolls. Before today I’d probably have told you it’s not sushi without raw fish, old me was wrong, these were delicious.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/--avHlV6xRKo/VL7yQU69NfI/AAAAAAAAUVI/ksJR4fGuG_M/w600-h500-no/15%2B-%2B1" alt="sushi"></p>

<p>I purchased a three month subscription from <a href="http://www.urthbox.com/">UrthBox</a> of healthy snacks. (Side note: I think UrthBox is good but expensive, they’ve had deals on Gilt City a lot lately) Quite a few were vegan. So I grabbed these fruit chews. </p>

<p>At first, I thought, “These aren’t much different than Starbursts!”. Then I found out, Starbursts aren’t vegan. Though some varieties appear not to have gelatin, it seems many incorporate Shellac in their confectioner’s glaze, which is derived from insects.</p>

<p>So given that, these were pretty fantastic.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-rQKxx_SyzPE/VL7sX61WhyI/AAAAAAAAUSs/Rfd8fTZpNi0/s640-no/15%2B-%2B1" alt="fruit chews"></p>

<p>J wanted to get out of the house for a little bit, so we went out and grabbed a quick dinner at a local indian fusion restaurant. They were super sweet and had tons of vegan options and substitutions. I ended up with a combo platter. Dark lighting but amazing meal.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/sWpSt-G6-5mTKl8sD_QWI1Mu-J9ZC7T8l1b39BdXYqkk=w600-h500-no" alt="dinner"></p>

<p><strong>How did I feel?</strong> </p>

<p>I definitely wasn’t hungry. Granted, I basically almost ate two lunches, but I didn’t find myself missing meat</p>

<p><strong>Could I go Vegan?</strong></p>

<p>If I had a vegan friend group, or a vegan significant other, definitely. But I am unfortunately a person who caves to social pressure and I really, really love eating non-vegan deep dish pizza with J.</p>

<p><strong>What will I keep from Veganism?</strong></p>

<p>That breakfast was amazing and I can’t believe it took me this long to make. Also, I’d be more willing to grab a vegan entree at work.</p>

<p>Are you vegan? Could you do vegan? What good vegan eats did I miss out on?</p>

	<p>Fridays are always sweeter when you have a 3 day weekend after them. </p>

<p>With a little extra time, J and I wanted to get out of the city for at least one night, so we&#39;re driving to Napa to get in a long bike ride and some wine tastings. Even Napa’s highways have bike lanes, so it’s one of my favorite places to cycle.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/mwTcYvm7wjyj05_r2VTcfiOMwnnCfTiFDYGHXuUYJfIu=w955-h716-no" alt="wine">
<div class="caption">Great outdoor patio, but we went because the winery looked casual enough for bikes.</div></p>

<p>New Year, New You, and all that. But New Year, New Vacations is where I’m at this week. I’ve been trying to make light plans to see family, friends, and get in some more great hikes. I might try to convince J to go to Utah again. But we’re leaning toward southeast Asia this year.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ypMSawCEbHHza4bUyWGJ4Nbaf-AqUC6OyvhlMEctTqtb=w955-h716-no" alt="making plans">
<div class="caption">Zion is the best National Park. Sorry.</div></p>

<p>My sister gifted me a grinder and some fancy coffee, so lately I’ve been trying to class it up and use a french press. If nothing else, it makes me feel way better about my morning. Also, I’m slowly collecting all the mugs I can. It’s probably my worst impulse purchase. At this moment, my apartment has more mugs than plates. Oops!</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/q4b4zynlcno6AE-BDNg-6L-1Pem_IjFuW_hZ4BrL-KYs=w704-h716-no" alt="good coffee"></p>

<p>I really need to make an appointment to get my lashes done again. When I saw this picture in my feed, it reminded me of why I do it. </p>

<p>Not affiliated with them or anything, but as the laziest person ever. I book literally every beauty appointment on <a href="//www.styleseat.com">Style Seat</a>. It&#39;s nice to keep my hair, eyelashes, and manicure appointments all in one place. And since I’m the worst at calling places, this is arguably my favorite start-up.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/jCI-vPiOtyoxn7DRHK-3yC-zcrdeC6I1a29DOztUC3S8=s716-no" alt="eyelashes">
<div class="caption">Best appointment ever, I sleep for two hours and wake up to lashes like this.</div></p>

<p>I finally booked a hotel for SeaWheeze. I’m staying at the Pan Pacific with the madre. Last year, I left this until the last minute and I was a wreck. Everything was like 600 dollars a night if you wanted to be anywhere within walking distance to the race. I finally discovered a <a href="http://ocanadahouse.com/">bed and breakfast</a>, which I’d strongly recommend, mom and I loved it. </p>

<p>But this year, I got an earlier start, and a great deal on <a href="//www.hotwire.com">Hotwire</a>, which puts us much closer to the starting line, and more importantly the showcase store. :) </p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-1luNQ70MoaM/VGrZutEVkmI/AAAAAAAAO5Q/iWZhd64aB2M/w955-h716-no/seawheeze.JPG" alt="seawheeze">
<div class="caption">I&#39;m mentally preparing for this madness again. :) </div></p>

<p>What are you looking forward to this weekend? Have you ever used Hotwire before? Honestly, it scared me a little not knowing what hotel you&#39;ll get when you book, but it was also kind of thrilling to find out.</p>

	<h1><a href="/1-15-2015/dessert-is-not-mandatory.html">How I’m eating in January: Dessert isn't Mandatory</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		January 15, 2015
	</div>

	<p>You know the book “Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus”? The entire premise is that there are undeniable differences between men and women. And while I’m no relationship counselor, I actually think J and I are pretty similar, similar values, similar thought processes, similar jobs. But the one thing we don’t have in common is that J doesn’t really like sugary sweets. And I crave them all the time.</p>

<p>Once I have one sugary treat, I slowly convince myself I should have another, and maybe another, and just one more. Honestly, I envy those who assert moderation with froyo, cookies, pancakes, etc. It isn’t something I think I’ll ever be able to do. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-FjdAIQNBw2Y/VLdRgvbZv-I/AAAAAAAATkw/Djxd6uO9Giw/w537-h716-no/15%2B-%2B1" alt=""><div class="caption">This wasn’t the only cookie.</div></p>

<p>And I get into this mindset that whenever I do something difficult, or stressful, or even mildly praiseworthy, I deserve a treat. Or that because my coworkers are having dessert after a meal, I too should be able to have a cupcake, cookie or froyo after every lunch like they do.</p>

<p>My goal for January, and the subsequent months, is to only have dessert when it’s something monumental. For example. Fro-yo at work? Not really a treat. It’s available every day, if I don’t have some today, I can come back and have some tomorrow. But macarons from Paris, a cake baked by a good friend for a wedding, or even a few bites of chocolate with wine while in Napa. Totally worth it.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/UYdzEpHjAl04ZJxIj7uBd79wukl8eHNIOdMK2h5DOxDA=w1041-h656-no" alt=""><div class="caption">I can’t decide whether I’m more sad, or impressed that I was able to make a froyo collage</div></p>

<p>There’s a lot of temptation, the same place I brew tea, grab water, or snag an orange also has fishbowls full of M&amp;Ms, Reeses, and more. And every meal at work has dessert alongside it. But having an easy rule, makes it easier to ignore.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/YwHpMLh6wcWef9Mh2pqBPhrMosInm-U2j8zcSu7CDYbc=w1041-h680-no" alt=""><div class="caption">There&#39;s even one of these filled with Justin&#39;s Nut Butters. How can I resist?</div></p>

<p>Because dessert isn’t something I’m owed. By eating my lunch, I didn’t do anything candy, cookie, cake-worthy. And, regardless, food shouldn’t be the primary way I reward myself.</p>

<p>I know some people love moderation, and I’m a big fan of you doing whatever works for you. One day, I hope to get to a place where I can practice moderation without finishing an entire pan of brownies in one sitting. :) But until then, I need to be a little stricter with myself.</p>

<p>Do you have food “rules”? Is there anything you won’t eat?</p>
