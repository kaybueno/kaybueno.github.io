<div id='about'>
	<h2>Hey there!</h2>

	<p id='lead'>I’m Kay. A 20 something living in San Francisco with my super adorable boyfriend.</p>

	<p>With such great weather, and such tiny apartments, we spend a lot of time hiking, running, and practicing yoga, but mostly trying new things. When I find out about something new, an addiction hits. And so, I’ve had a little bit of every hobby, from trapeze to tennis. </p>

	<p>I’m really interested in staying healthy while exploring and trying new things. I love trying new foods, challenging myself to give up my vices, and overall growing myself as a person.</p>

	<p>San Francisco is my first home outside of the good old midwest, and so I’m excited to be blogging in hopes to cultivate a broader group of friendships outside of the people I know here.</p>
