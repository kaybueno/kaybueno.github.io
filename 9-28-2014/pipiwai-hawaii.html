	<p>Ughhh. I’ve been sick this entire weekend, and looking at pictures of me hiking and healthy in Hawaii was just too much to handle. But I wanted to get the rest of the trip up on the blog before I lose any more momentum and just start blogging cute exercise clothes I want to buy or something.</p>

<p>J and I were last in Hana. Having completed the infamous Road to Hana trip. It was our first (and only) night on the east side of the island. So we wanted to catch sunrise.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-FSauXjXzYew/VB-ojuZn_SI/AAAAAAAALVg/PBok97Nk0HM/w1062-h708-no/IMG_0770.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Needless to say, it was worth it.</p>

<p>Getting up for sunrise made it easy for us to grab an early start. After the sun came up, we headed out to the Oheo Gulch, aka the Seven Sacred Pools. It’s technically an extension of Haleakala National Park, although it only has two trails. The trail down to the pools, and the Pipiwai trail. We did both.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-0Dr3qSBlCjY/VB-o5uw9KHI/AAAAAAAALXU/mlyxhqwko60/w1062-h708-no/IMG_0950.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>The trek down to the pools is short, sweet, and passes by that giant tree you see above. Unfortunately, during our trip, the pools were pretty dry, with only one, maybe two to swim in. If you don’t bring your suit (we didn’t) there’s not a whole lot to see at the pools. It’s a great place to float, relax, and grab a nice tan, but not much else. You can see the swimmers behind Jon’s head in this snap at the pools.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-CDezCLEVcLY/VB-o-DtnmxI/AAAAAAAALXo/gfPzABdMwI8/w1062-h708-no/IMG_0998.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>So we headed to the Pipiwai trail. This is one of those hikes that really makes you wait for the good parts. It was 80 or 90 degrees, humid, and most of the waterfalls along the way were pretty dry. Out of need for shade (and a break from walking on an exposed trail uphill) we stopped to climb a tree.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-mLGFEyfU9lM/VB-pFHBlbSI/AAAAAAAALYQ/ReaYECKIg74/w477-h716-no/IMG_1020.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>After a mile and a half in or so (doesn’t sound like much until your ass is sweating, hiking up hill, with no shade). You reach the bamboo forest. When I read about this before going, I was kind of underwhelmed. Like “Woo hoo, what’s so cool about a bunch of bamboo?”</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AN6al0HCxBU/VB-pJqZY2CI/AAAAAAAALYk/GYgBh4tlqIQ/w477-h716-no/IMG_1025.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>I’ll tell you what! Bamboo sounds like deep, hollow, wind chimes whenever a breeze rolls through. Add that to the fact that our path was shaded, and J and I thought it was the greatest thing ever. </p>

<p>It felt pretty surreal to walk through the bamboo though, it’s just not a plant or experience we ever get at home.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-N5e9UihtbT0/VB-pJ0C3HvI/AAAAAAAALYo/wX2JecS77pc/w1062-h708-no/IMG_1029.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>After what seems like a lot of bamboo. You hit the end! Which is this beautiful waterfall. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-zWSDob6NLq4/VB-pLv1NOJI/AAAAAAAALYw/_bil7P3IRLo/w1062-h708-no/IMG_1035.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>The sign we’re standing in front of said to not cross it, or fear getting swept away and dying. However, the current ahead was nothing more than a trickle, so we (and basically the other 20 people who hiked there) went past the sign. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7IK926oKYFM/VB-pRNkY7vI/AAAAAAAALZM/mqR1kXn5D6c/w477-h716-no/IMG_1050.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>That’s the entire falls (with J at the bottom for scale). It was huge, and beautiful. But very very slim. A lot of the falls were almost dry when we visited. And like the pools at it’s base, there were groups of people who came to the falls to swim. So, word to the wise, in Maui, basically, always wear a suit. Or, always be swimming… Or something</p>

<p>We hiked back to the car. Left Hana, and got lunch. We stopped at the Naihiku market and J got the most amazing fried ahi tuna ever.</p>

<p>It doesn’t look like much, but the fish was fresh caught, and fried in front of us, and was probably, no joke, the best food we had on Maui. The passion fruit, aka lilikoi, aka get in my stomach best fruit ever, was good too.</p>

<p>We finished our drive, took some pictures of the scenery (which is beautiful, even if J doesn’t look enthused in the photo below) and went back for a relaxing evening in Wailea.</p>
