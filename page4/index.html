	<p>I survived an incredibly busy crazy weekend off Soylent.</p>

<p>To try to maintain some social life, I’m not drinking soylent from Friday night to Sunday night. It allows me to still indulge in regular food, crazy activities, and life without a blender bottle strapped to myself.</p>

<p>The most adorable things I ate this weekend:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-1BMoGda3Bt8/U_F4jUYsskI/AAAAAAAAHVc/znTwOUaT5xw/w643-h716-no/IMG_2822.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>In more exciting news! J’s coworker got married this weekend, which called for a lot of celebrating. The wedding was north of the city in San Rafael, aka Sun Rafael because it’s soooo much warmer. The ceremony was a balmy 90 degrees, but the reception cooled down to a sweet 70. </p>

<p>Crossing the bridge.</p>

<p>The oak the ceremony was held under. The theme? Love grows here.</p>

<p>Overall, this weekend, Soylent taught me how much extra I’ve been eating. I felt more uneasy eating full meals, and I’ve been noticing the heaviness of certain ingredients (sugar, sugar, sugar). My stomach gets upset when it gets to a level I would have considered full just a week ago. And I find myself taking slower, smaller bites.</p>

<p>On the bright side, spending a week on soylent makes everything taste more flavorful. Spices are hotter and more complex. Cuts of meat seem much juicier. Produce is almost unreal after four days of an unarguably bland liquid. </p>

<p>I’ve had mixed feelings about returning to my Soylent only diet tomorrow. Part of me is incredibly excited not to have to think about food. It complicates my life a lot. But another piece of me is sad to give up on all the flavors, tastes, and overindulgences I’ve had this weekend.</p>

<p>I’ve definitely seen a trend down in my weight over the days I’ve had Soylent, which is unsurprising and also wonderful. I’m hoping this mix of soylent and “normal” food will continue to work for me.</p>

	<p>I live in a teeny tiny apartment, my kitchen is probably the size of a lot of people’s closets. And as such, there are only a few small cabinets for storage. So when you receive 40 pounds of food at once, you have to, as Tim Gunn would say, make it work.</p>

<p>This wall has become my make shift pantry.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-SxnftEyBGXY/U-zkSJ4PMrI/AAAAAAAAHLs/_-aN1l9n0NE/s716-no/IMG_2763.JPG" alt="Soylent Wall"></p>

<p>I had no idea what to expect size wise with soylent. And so, I shipped soylent to myself at work, (it would have gotten nicked from my door), not realizing that each week is about 10 pounds. So I’m delivered this pallet of soylent that I have to haul down stairs, across the parking lot, and then up to my apartment. When I finally made it to the apartment, I was covered in sweat and basically looked like a cartoon character shoving my soylent up the last few steps.</p>

<p>Speaking of work, I have a favorite mirror for selfies there. I love it, it’s super flattering, and really really large. But the situation’s a little awkward, because in order to maintain looking professional amongst my coworkers I have to make sure I snap the picture when no one else is there. So I’m always awkwardly looking around making sure the coast is clear and then posing like an idiot.</p>

<p>This weekend is so crazy. I have a friend coming to stay with me for 2 weeks, and she missed her birthday. So I wrapped up a bunch of small things. Then we also have a wedding, an ikea trip, and a bunch of touristy stuff to drag my buddy to. </p>

<p>I’m never going to get any sleep!</p>

<p>What’s your weekend looking like?</p>

	<p>I almost cried over two out of three of those today.</p>

<p>I’ll fill you in. I have a huge crush on Jonathan Adler. I don’t even know what he looks like, or if he’s a good person. But I love his designs. So when he came out with a cheaper department store line, I bought a ton up. </p>

<p>Unfortunately I had to ship it to my new apartment, and in the process, one of my favorite pieces, an elephant lamp shattered. :( I’ve been super glue-ing him back together, but I’ve had to glue so much, I ran out. Here he is in a mostly fixed state. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-DkiXGQnn_L0/U-uOF9toaII/AAAAAAAAHCc/JmSyqfB2evk/w837-h716-no/IMG_2724.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Then today, on the way to work, I got a flat tire on my bike. Which seemed okay, because I had a tube and pump at work. So I worked at replacing the tube (I’m a total bike fixing novice, this took me basically forever), after many attempts to pump my bike, I found out the needle was broken, so the new tube won’t even inflate. </p>

<p>Here was a glory photo from when I thought I fixed it. Haha. WRONG.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/6ghX3zG0Q0a58C0eR-EJHKXSITQEi6rSTgHfdROCIDA=w567-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Otherwise, my day was amazing. I took a beautiful walk at lunch and came across the most bizarre 80’s style fitness track. You can walk around and stop at all these little stations in the woods to work on different skills. I skipped the fitness stations, but eventually I want to come out and play with the rings station. One of my dream goals for life is to be able to do a pull up, and it could be fun to do some aerial skills on this thing:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/loAPNvxCXKdujF5v10SSvcMQfggSCx50DhhmToaDzKs=w567-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Soylent today has been good. It’s hard doing an experiment on yourself. Like I’ve felt a little eugh when it comes to digestive issues. Fortunately, I have yet to become a noxious gas machine like some drinkers report. (Knock on wood). But I definitely felt a little on edge today. However, two of my coworkers went home sick. So is it a stomach bug? Soylent? Guess I’ll find out in a few days.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-63QYJDPwtOc/U-uQM0rbulI/AAAAAAAAHGY/n8WIgvAJfuE/w548-h716-no/IMG_2727.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>My batch today tasted the best yet though. Getting good measurements on a food scale has helped a lot with that. (Since I don’t want to drink a whole 2000 calorie bag). And actually, this is probably disgusting, but I don’t mind it luke warm. I chill it overnight for whatever reason, but I actually kind of enjoy it after it’s gotten back to room temperature. </p>

<p>Whatever, I’m crazy. Hope everyone else’s day went better than my own. :)</p>

	<p>I&#39;ve been making my daily batch of Soylent the night before. I’ve heard letting sit, makes the liquid less gritty, and also, it gives me more time in the morning to get ready. I’m lazy, so I just measure, blend, and then shove the entire blender in the fridge for the night. (minus the base, guys, I’m not an idiot.)</p>

<p>Doing this means I can wake up, re-blend for a second to reintegrate the oils that have separated (delicious) and go.</p>

<p>Sorry in advance for all the selfies. After yesterdays photos, I needed a lot of make up and good angles in today&#39;s post. :)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/CBPIJcl_0fF156E36fX72nMsovGURT9_nj8CHpo-Wb4=w715-h716-no" alt="Kay plus blender"></p>

<p>Day two was as easy, or easier than day one. I actually have a hard time finishing all the soylent by the end of the day. I need to drink more in the morning, because before Soylent, I most naturally ate the most during the day.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/X7WEWJiQj3U3FK0prUDv7JoAQ5CWblBWoAbV4EnI2bs=w903-h716-no" alt="soylent in blender bottle"> </p>

<p>So far, no one in person has noticed or asked me about my kind of bizarre eating habits, which is really relieving, because honestly, I don&#39;t really want to explain. My suggestion for keeping it under wraps? I&#39;ve been able to fit it all in a blender bottle, which you can see in basically every picture. So it&#39;s pretty small and inconspicuous. </p>

<p>But, I&#39;m still worried, I can&#39;t avoid lunch with the coworkers forever. Lately, I&#39;ve been hoping to do non-eating activities during my normal lunch break. I figure walking, and yoga can replace my usual munching. Unfortunately, the last two lunches, I’ve just been doing work at my desk. Uggggh.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-u2nb_4jLKjk/U-pS_OfZHMI/AAAAAAAAHAk/4ZrTT4QX3gg/s716-no/IMG_2705-MIX.jpg" alt="Quad selfies"> </p>

<p>Overall though, I feel even, and happy not making choices. The last two days have been fairly stressful, and usually that would mean I’d be chomping my way through snacks and coffee at work. But I haven’t. I mean, I still drink coffee, tea, and other nearly 0 calorie beverages. But I’m not trying to binge my stress away.</p>

<p>It&#39;s silly but, I want magical results at day two, so then I’d feel like I have something great to tell you, or to write about. So far, I haven’t exercised heavily since drinking soylent, but I’m hoping to do a good run tomorrow and see how it goes!</p>
