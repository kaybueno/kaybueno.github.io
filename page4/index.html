	<h1><a href="/2-4-2015/paleo-WIAW.html">Paleo/Primal Inspired WIAW</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		February 4, 2015
	</div>

	<p>A few weeks ago, I challenged myself to explore different diets on <a href="http://peasandcrayons.com/2015/02/ate-wednesday-211-feed-seymour.html">WIAW</a>. One of the main reasons I wanted to take on more diverse eating styles for WIAW, was to shake up my current routine. Trying <a href="http://www.kaybueno.com/1-21-2015/vegan-WIAW.html">vegan</a> was great, but it was already an eating style I was relatively comfortable with, and one that my current lifestyle and workplace made easy.</p>

<p>This week I was inspired by the Paleo/Primal/Keto diets out there. Now. I say inspired because I think it’s naive to think I can read about a way of eating, emulate it for a day, and really understand the workings. If you follow <a href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/">Mark’s Daily Apple</a>, <a href="http://robbwolf.com/">Robb Wolf</a>, or even <a href="http://paleomg.com/">PaleOMG</a>, you’re going to get a much more developed view of these diets. For me, I just wanted to shuck routine, and maybe even find a new eating style I was better suited to.</p>

<p>I had to prep a lot for this week, and I didn’t even finish all the prep I wanted to. I took a lot of inspiration from <a href="https://ieatirunblog.wordpress.com/2014/08/04/recipe-nut-bombs-primal-fruit-parfait/">IEatIRun</a>.</p>

<p>I started with a twist on her nut bombs. (I was out of almonds). Which are pretty similar to most of the energy bites out there. Even post paleo experimenting, I’ve been eating these on a regular basis. Enough to have made them twice now. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-UEIErzYhiMc/VMcuid51EXI/AAAAAAAAUyI/6Fkwwwzg7J8/w1041-h702-no/IMG_6432.JPG" alt="snack prep"></p>

<p>Breakfast was also an IEatIRun rip off. I made a coconut cream parfait, with crumbled nut bombs, a few sliced strawberries and coconut cream from <a href="http://cookeatpaleo.com/how-to-make-coconut-whipped-cream/">this recipe</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/QzlnUACF12QKFkfgG_a_6lzSps2TQc4E4rOn5VR0tgdB=w868-h716-no" alt="breakfast"></p>

<p>For lunch I was stuck with what was at work. When consulting with a friend who eats Paleo at the same company, he told me his biggest issue was finding food that wasn’t cooked in canola oil. Fortunately, I got lucky with olive oil ahi tuna, a salad, and zucchini dressed in an avocado, citrus, and olive oil dressing.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-TmTTKcy45to/VNG1RjQA9RI/AAAAAAAAVP0/s9pe8iac0OI/w962-h716-no/15%2B-%2B4" alt="lunch"></p>

<p>I was swamped with work until dinner, but I had brought nut bombs in case I couldn’t find a reasonable snack. I popped one before and Iyengar yoga class. (A good stretch, but not my beloved Vinyasa.)</p>

<p>For dinner, I grabbed a pesto chicken breast, smothered it in a chipotle salsa, and had a side salad and guacamole. I don’t know why I don’t eat this dinner more often...</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/jE1J_zJ2v5Hhtx2BmqBuuiS4EE8hXpRbQHhk7fPF1sUi=w964-h716-no" alt="dinner"></p>

<p>Overall, this was definitely a blast, and definitely out of my usual element for food choices. I had to be a little more discerning. I&#39;d love to up my paleo trend to a week, or a month, but I have a few consistent meals that don&#39;t really fit right now. So I&#39;ll have to get to planning.</p>

<p>Do you eat paleo? Have you ever tried it?</p>

	<h1><a href="/2-3-2015/new-workouts.html">My New Workouts</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		February 3, 2015
	</div>

	<p>At the beginning of the year, I <a href="http://www.kaybueno.com/1-1-2015/resolutions.html">challenged myself</a> to quite a few fitness feats.</p>

<p>Last year I achieved a lot in terms of flexibility, and running. I completed my first half marathon, and regular yoga sessions have helped me feel almost bendy and stretchy. But even with improvements there, I’ve been incredibly deficient when it comes to strength. I can barely do a couple of solid push ups, and I’m nowhere near my dream goal. One pull up.</p>

<p>So I’ve been working through some plyometric circuits to improve strength. So far, I’ve been really really ridiculously sore. (But happy!) While I’m not ready for heavy weights yet. (I think this is the road to weight lifting addiction). This has been my current set up.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-FJ1Rh5fkjv0/VNBmipn6lkI/AAAAAAAAVLE/CjmF3ss754A/w699-h716-no/IMG_6541.JPG" alt=""><div class="caption">The bare necessities.</div></p>

<p>I end up doing about 30 minutes of circuits. Today focused on legs, and had a bunch of squats, lunges, box step-ups, and jumping. While I still feel like a goon during the workout, I was much smoother, and less tired this week.</p>

<p>My biggest dilemma right now, is that, in order to fit this in along with my other training, it means I’m working out twice a day, five days a week. Which might not be too bad, except that work has been pretty swamped lately. The reason I have a giant exercise room to myself in these pictures is because I’m working out at 9pm. Well after most people have left the office.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-5ywotTF0G1A/VNBmjgHDTtI/AAAAAAAAVLM/BBFgjkXUpm4/w955-h716-no/IMG_6542.JPG" alt=""><div class="caption">My least favorite part. The jump rope. 5 year old me is disappointed.</div></p>

<p>Right now, I do both “activities” at night. After the gym clears out, and once my work is done. If I could, I’d love to do a morning session, and an evening session, but I can’t find any way to swing that with my schedule. (The extra morning shower is what kills it!) So lately, I’ve just been trying to hit both workouts, and if I don’t. Well. I don’t.</p>

<p>On the bright side, I’m really loving the plyometric workouts. While I hate every minute of them while I’m doing them. I kind of missed being this sore. (Is that weird, it’s weird?) And I feel better balanced fitting them in.</p>

<p>My other favorite part? They fit anywhere. Which is super convenient because I’m meeting my sister in Vegas in 10 days! </p>

<p>When and where do you workout? What types of exercises are your favorite?</p>

	<h1><a href="/2-2-2015/weekend-update.html">Weekend Update</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		February 2, 2015
	</div>

	<p>Ain’t no party like a Communist Party, ‘cuz a Communist Party is mandatory.</p>

<p>This weekend we celebrated the fact that two of J’s roommates, and also the fall of the Berlin Wall have been around 25 years with a “Communist Party”. (If slightly off color humor, or potentially offensive recreations of history are not your thing, avoid this post.)</p>

<p>We crafted a foam Berlin wall to bring down at midnight and celebrated the fall of communism. While this may be the oddest party theme ever, there were a surprising amount of good costumes. A testament to the crazy things you can get at surplus stores on Haight St.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/EMntbgaUErXxhbjhTii_ks-OXC0Ptfs8o-_niZ7-EVFU=w484-h716-no" alt=""><div class=caption>Many vodka sodas were consumed in the making of this picture.</div></p>

<p>While, usually, I’m not much for big raging parties, it’s fun once or twice a year to feel my age and do it up. It’s also not every day you find out what your boyfriend would look like as Ronald Reagan. So. There’s that.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/rD0idEnJjKLqfxWg7PT-2LC9Zzku290LgwwxiOtzoGvB=w682-h716-no" alt=""><div class=caption>This is what my nightmares are made of.</div></p>

<p>Sunday morning I was supposed to run a 5k, while <a href="//www.almostgettingittogether.com">Cassie</a> did the half. Unfortunately, after a night of bacchanalia, I was not ready for the 6:30 a.m. wake up call that came along with the run. So I made amends by offering to grab brunch.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/pZC6ifW458ujpOKdbh88FE2VgZaj7l_YhcEpQ-FuzUg-=w1041-h607-no" alt=""><div class=caption>You just gained 5 pounds looking at this sandwich. :)</div></p>

<p>We hit up a carnival themed cafe, and J convinced me to get this incredibly delicious monstrosity, aka a Chicken and Waffle sandwich. Easily one of the best waffles I’ve had. Which was good since waffles are both wonderful hangover food, and half marathon recovery food.</p>

<p>I then did the most un-American thing imaginable, and ditched the Super Bowl to run errands with Cassie. It was magical and now I want to buy everything imaginable from West Elm. Thank god I don’t own a car to haul it back to my house in.</p>

	<h1><a href="/1-28-2015/WIAW-sick.html">What I ate Wednesday, when I was sick.</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		January 28, 2015
	</div>

	<p>I had a beautiful WIAW planned that was supposed to feature ingredients and plates that looked something like the picture above.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, when I woke up, I felt miserable. I could barely taste anything (such a waste), and my throat was scratchy and sore. And all my beautiful plans of nuts and other healthy fats were lost to ideas of soup and frozen drinks.</p>

<p>Being sick is hard enough, but trying to make decent food choices when you feel like your throat is made of sandpaper is quite the struggle. Between approximately 285 cups of tea, and a few shots of DayQuil, here’s <a href="//www.peasandcrayons.com">WIAW</a>.</p>

<p>I started the morning with a mango, orange, banana smoothie, and a bowl of apple cinnamon teff cereal. Having never had teff as a breakfast item, it&#39;s pretty close in taste to cream of wheat, or oatmeal. Its texture is much finer, almost like chia, or maybe even as fine as sand.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/UVSoTGXafWQwo_cmMrtKVUPipRdIgTVpqIGx63HfP7Ij=s716-no" alt=""><div class=caption></div></p>

<p>During lunch I made a break for the soup bar, after filling a bowl, I grabbed a plate of salad, sushi, and quinoa. Since you can&#39;t get Mom&#39;s chicken and dumpling (or noodle if you&#39;re a purist) when you&#39;re 2000 miles away, miso soup and some greens is about as good as it gets.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Odqw1ug7eRk/VMiaEPLgjUI/AAAAAAAAU4U/lcIl3ATrp9I/w1041-h605-no/15%2B-%2B2" alt=""></p>

<p>For snacks I headed to the juice bar, and grabbed a ginger and greens juice and some blueberry oatmeal bites. The bites didn’t really taste like much, but that may have been because I’m sick, or because the juice killed my pallette with a ginger bomb. I&#39;m kind of infatuated with my juice bar, the employees are always cheery, and mix the best drinks. I give them my ailment (DOMS, illness, 3pm fog), and they find me a juice. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Z2Gj4LM40HY/VMiaEN1gb6I/AAAAAAAAU34/OZKquYFxSTc/s716-no/15%2B-%2B4" alt=""></p>

<p>At the end of the night I grabbed Ramen with some friends. Hands down the best meal of the day. The spicyness made me forget I ever had sinuses, and the bowl came out so hot that it was basically a noodle sauna.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-xo8Bj1urVR8/VMiaEDTh69I/AAAAAAAAU3s/iIyWZk_Qcjo/w784-h716-no/15%2B-%2B5" alt=""></p>

<p>I&#39;ve got to tell you, I&#39;m so over being sick. When I was a kid, I remember having a light cold as being kind of fun. You got to stay home from school, watch TV, read, chill. Now, having a head cold just means I have to focus more to get my everything at work done, and I feel like I&#39;m wearing a perpetual nose plug, which makes eating, exercising, and talking so much fun. Sexy. I know.</p>

<p>How do you get over a cold? What&#39;s the best thing to eat when you&#39;re sick? :(</p>
