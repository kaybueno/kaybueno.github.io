	<h1><a href="/2-2-2015/weekend-update.html">Weekend Update</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		February 2, 2015
	</div>

	<p>Ain’t no party like a Communist Party, ‘cuz a Communist Party is mandatory.</p>

<p>This weekend we celebrated the fact that two of J’s roommates, and also the fall of the Berlin Wall have been around 25 years with a “Communist Party”. (If slightly off color humor, or potentially offensive recreations of history are not your thing, avoid this post.)</p>

<p>We crafted a foam Berlin wall to bring down at midnight and celebrated the fall of communism. While this may be the oddest party theme ever, there were a surprising amount of good costumes. A testament to the crazy things you can get at surplus stores on Haight St.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/EMntbgaUErXxhbjhTii_ks-OXC0Ptfs8o-_niZ7-EVFU=w484-h716-no" alt=""><div class=caption>Many vodka sodas were consumed in the making of this picture.</div></p>

<p>While, usually, I’m not much for big raging parties, it’s fun once or twice a year to feel my age and do it up. It’s also not every day you find out what your boyfriend would look like as Ronald Reagan. So. There’s that.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/rD0idEnJjKLqfxWg7PT-2LC9Zzku290LgwwxiOtzoGvB=w682-h716-no" alt=""><div class=caption>This is what my nightmares are made of.</div></p>

<p>Sunday morning I was supposed to run a 5k, while <a href="//www.almostgettingittogether.com">Cassie</a> did the half. Unfortunately, after a night of bacchanalia, I was not ready for the 6:30 a.m. wake up call that came along with the run. So I made amends by offering to grab brunch.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/pZC6ifW458ujpOKdbh88FE2VgZaj7l_YhcEpQ-FuzUg-=w1041-h607-no" alt=""><div class=caption>You just gained 5 pounds looking at this sandwich. :)</div></p>

<p>We hit up a carnival themed cafe, and J convinced me to get this incredibly delicious monstrosity, aka a Chicken and Waffle sandwich. Easily one of the best waffles I’ve had. Which was good since waffles are both wonderful hangover food, and half marathon recovery food.</p>

<p>I then did the most un-American thing imaginable, and ditched the Super Bowl to run errands with Cassie. It was magical and now I want to buy everything imaginable from West Elm. Thank god I don’t own a car to haul it back to my house in.</p>

	<h1><a href="/1-28-2015/WIAW-sick.html">What I ate Wednesday, when I was sick.</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		January 28, 2015
	</div>

	<p>I had a beautiful WIAW planned that was supposed to feature ingredients and plates that looked something like the picture above.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, when I woke up, I felt miserable. I could barely taste anything (such a waste), and my throat was scratchy and sore. And all my beautiful plans of nuts and other healthy fats were lost to ideas of soup and frozen drinks.</p>

<p>Being sick is hard enough, but trying to make decent food choices when you feel like your throat is made of sandpaper is quite the struggle. Between approximately 285 cups of tea, and a few shots of DayQuil, here’s <a href="//www.peasandcrayons.com">WIAW</a>.</p>

<p>I started the morning with a mango, orange, banana smoothie, and a bowl of apple cinnamon teff cereal. Having never had teff as a breakfast item, it&#39;s pretty close in taste to cream of wheat, or oatmeal. Its texture is much finer, almost like chia, or maybe even as fine as sand.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/UVSoTGXafWQwo_cmMrtKVUPipRdIgTVpqIGx63HfP7Ij=s716-no" alt=""><div class=caption></div></p>

<p>During lunch I made a break for the soup bar, after filling a bowl, I grabbed a plate of salad, sushi, and quinoa. Since you can&#39;t get Mom&#39;s chicken and dumpling (or noodle if you&#39;re a purist) when you&#39;re 2000 miles away, miso soup and some greens is about as good as it gets.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Odqw1ug7eRk/VMiaEPLgjUI/AAAAAAAAU4U/lcIl3ATrp9I/w1041-h605-no/15%2B-%2B2" alt=""></p>

<p>For snacks I headed to the juice bar, and grabbed a ginger and greens juice and some blueberry oatmeal bites. The bites didn’t really taste like much, but that may have been because I’m sick, or because the juice killed my pallette with a ginger bomb. I&#39;m kind of infatuated with my juice bar, the employees are always cheery, and mix the best drinks. I give them my ailment (DOMS, illness, 3pm fog), and they find me a juice. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Z2Gj4LM40HY/VMiaEN1gb6I/AAAAAAAAU34/OZKquYFxSTc/s716-no/15%2B-%2B4" alt=""></p>

<p>At the end of the night I grabbed Ramen with some friends. Hands down the best meal of the day. The spicyness made me forget I ever had sinuses, and the bowl came out so hot that it was basically a noodle sauna.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-xo8Bj1urVR8/VMiaEDTh69I/AAAAAAAAU3s/iIyWZk_Qcjo/w784-h716-no/15%2B-%2B5" alt=""></p>

<p>I&#39;ve got to tell you, I&#39;m so over being sick. When I was a kid, I remember having a light cold as being kind of fun. You got to stay home from school, watch TV, read, chill. Now, having a head cold just means I have to focus more to get my everything at work done, and I feel like I&#39;m wearing a perpetual nose plug, which makes eating, exercising, and talking so much fun. Sexy. I know.</p>

<p>How do you get over a cold? What&#39;s the best thing to eat when you&#39;re sick? :(</p>

	<h1><a href="/1-27-2015/no-excuses.html">Living #NoExcuses, when all I want to do is make excuses.</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		January 27, 2015
	</div>

	<p>Lately, I’ve been a part of Sweat Pink’s #NoExcuses challenge, and this week they asked us to “Share why YOU live with #NoExcuses”.</p>

<p>And when I received that email. I almost laughed. See, I definitely don’t live with #NoExcuses, I live with many excuses, loads of excuses. In fact, I’m probably on my way to being the queen of excuses. </p>

<p>And when it comes to exercising, I’m that person who throughout the day, is thinking of all the socially appropriate ways to evade my gym plans. But when the clock hits 6pm, I (usually!) still go work out. Because, while I live with a whole bunch of excuses, I make sure I eliminate them.</p>

<p>My most popular excuses and how I combat them:</p>

<h2>1. I don’t have my [article of workout wear], so I can’t workout today!</h2>

<p>This has been as pathetic as “I don’t have a hairband, guess I can’t go to the gym!”</p>

<p>To beat this excuse I use my filing cabinet, not for documents and files, but for spare gym clothes. Currently I have 5 shirts, 2 pairs of socks, a spare pair of shoes, a million hair ties and a water bottle.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Pr1zliR6qR_aFw0KLMn168BA263Bwdp4pvbXUeqZd5Cu=w777-h672-no" alt="">
<div class="caption">I know, my filing cabinet outfits do not match.</div>
<br></p>

<h2>2) I have a lot of work to do, and I’m too tired to workout.</h2>

<p>This is probably my most convincing excuse, because my job does take priority over fitness. (Otherwise I&#39;d do 8 hour days of vinyasa and soul cycle. But it doesn&#39;t pay the bills yo.) </p>

<p>And it might be a good excuse if there wasn&#39;t a gym onsite where I can always get a speedy workout in. Even if I&#39;m so brain dead I can&#39;t manage the gym, I can always take a 30 minute walk to think things over.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/1qJlC77bHMvcAHS3QyCX8din9KlLWW_1INf-Ss-bMlIH=s446-no" alt="">
<div class="caption">If every workoout looked like this, I swear, I&#39;d never skip.</div>
<br></p>

<h2>3) I can’t find time to work-out, or there&#39;s an event I can’t skip is going on when I usually head to the gym.</h2>

<p>I try to remind myself that fitness is a priority, and that many people wake up incredibly early in order to squeeze it in. (Like 5 a.m. early.) I can (and should) do that too.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/UE3f8YiJSUV41bOSZQnFiqs2h0vqQr4om3YFcmQE0fgt=w566-h672-no" alt=""><div class="caption">Besting my excuses gets me to the post gym selfie..</div></p>

<p>To me, living #NoExcuses isn&#39;t a matter of never having excuses, it&#39;s working on subtracting them until you get to #NoExcuses. </p>

<p>Excuses are part of my day to day, but moving past the excuses is what makes me proud, it&#39;s what makes me a competitor, and it&#39;s what makes me live &quot;#NoExcuses&quot;.</p>

<p>What are your excuses? And how do you get past them?</p>

	<h1><a href="/1-26-2015/weekend-eats.html">A weekend of eats!</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		January 26, 2015
	</div>

	<p>Thanks so much for all your sympathy over the crash! J has mostly received tough love from his manly roommates, and so it was nice to read all your lovely comments to him.</p>

<p>This weekend was the least vain weekend of all time, I managed to take almost no photos of myself. Partially because I was home, helping take care of J, and not out adventuring, and partially because I spent most of my weekend eating really delicious food.</p>

<p>Saturday night I went out with <a href="//www.almostgettingittogether.com">Cassie</a>, to Cha-ya. It’s a vegetarian/vegan Japanese restaurant that is so hole-in-the-wall, it doesn’t even have a website. Which may be the norm for non-chain restaurants in a lot of cities, but even the <a href="http://www.letsbefrankdogs.com/">grass fed hotdog stand</a> in my neighborhood has it’s own site. So not being on the internet here is kind of a big deal.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-xtckJoAjNhc/VMXtbycCoKI/AAAAAAAAUcY/pUCfBCa8eTo/s716-no/IMG_6355.JPG" alt=""><div class="caption">My suggestion? Order avocado everything.</div></p>

<p>Sunday night I met up with a friend to try out a Rhythm and Motion dance class. It was quite an adventure, primarily because I barely have rhythm, and mostly have motion. My biggest takeaway? I totally underestimated dancers, I was dripping in sweat by end.</p>

<p>I know I probably shouldn’t take on more things, but I really loved the class and might continue to go on Sunday nights. Can you pick up dance if you’re only doing it one night a week?</p>

<p>After class we met up with another friend and cooked dinner. Or really, to be fair, they cooked me dinner. It was phenomenal, and I apologize that my pictures don&#39;t do it any justice. I was too focused on enjoying the company and the candlelight to take good photos.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/CVE_vrsa_m7WGU8LJMyxwpKCCMqdbzhGaWKI8i5ca4xK=w958-h716-no" alt=""><div class="caption">Frisee salad with bacon, poached egg, and a bacon mustard vinaigrette.</div></p>

<p>We planned the dinner around my friend who is doing keto (with some serious success!) I was mostly impressed with how delicious keto is. Yum. Bacon. Egg. Cheese. Yum.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-6-ji7SCwjuA/VMXvNKLtZjI/AAAAAAAAUgg/zFMsWyMB96c/w955-h716-no/15%2B-%2B1" alt=""><div class="caption">Roasted chicken with a roasted cauliflower and broccolini done “mac &amp; cheese” style.</div></p>

<p>This is one of the first times I’ve been convinced you can cook better at home than in a restaurant. Everything was amazing.</p>

<p>The cutest picture of my weekend? A sleepy great dane I ran into on a walk I did. He, or maybe she, was chilling in the front of a designer eyewear shop. Makes me miss my mom’s dog. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-5MEWODkUSvg/VMXtQl9ogoI/AAAAAAAAUas/dS4syAxWnpQ/w955-h716-no/IMG_6340.JPG" alt=""><div class="caption">San Francisco&#39;s dog population isn&#39;t helping my puppy fever.</div></p>

<p>How was your weekend? What should I do about the dance class? How often do you work out in a week?</p>
