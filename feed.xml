        <title>WIAW, Super Busy Edition</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-FHfWpYBm7Xk/VQBhkChVf1I/AAAAAAAAYVo/onR0C180ers/w794-h500-p-k-no/15%2B-%2B2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lately my life has been focused on two things. Getting into half marathon shape for the Pittsburgh Half, and work. My days go like: wake up, get ready, walk to work, work, run, walk home from work, prepare snack, sleep. So, while it’s kept me busy, it’s also been a hard thing to blog, or read blogs, or keep up with the Bachelor, or really anything that’s not walking/running, sleeping, eating, or working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I have serious love for &lt;a href=&quot;http://thebigmansworld.com/&quot;&gt;WIAW&lt;/a&gt; (and our sexy new WIAW host). And I can’t imagine missing it even if I’ve been a slacker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Breakfast:
Two vegan pancakes, a scramble, and bacon. I’m not sold on this breakfast yet, but I’ve been eating it for the past few days. I love eating it, but I’m not sure it’s keeping me as satiated as it should be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-rjN-yCz9JGM/VQBhkL-iwuI/AAAAAAAAYVg/_bhVFl3h2CA/s1168-no/15%2B-%2B1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lunch:
I’m sharing two lunches, one I ate Monday to brag, and Tuesday’s for honesty. Monday, I went to our new salad bar, where they’ll mix you a custom salad, yum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/8D51LZM9FONKo5SQXQcDLIcAemBd1ftegYjYwidqJYX_=w1168-h1009-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Tuesday I had salad and flatbread. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-FHfWpYBm7Xk/VQBhkChVf1I/AAAAAAAAYVo/onR0C180ers/w1168-h876-no/15%2B-%2B2&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A coworker and I stopped at the juice bar for a snack. Delish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-XGHtpLYW7rI/VQBhkBwPu6I/AAAAAAAAYVU/wsnGMiXrvnU/s1168-no/15%2B-%2B3&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then I had an unpictured Quest bar and an apple pear. Yum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t run yesterday since I usually run Mon, Weds, Fri, and Sat. But I’ve been really hardcore about clocking in steps on my Fitbit. I’m at a little more than 120,000 for the week, or close to 9 miles a day. So I walked to Trader Joes a few miles away, and walked home. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I picked up some truffle cheese, and fig and olive crisps. And ate those right before bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-6AYnHCJ-big/VQBhkDBgOgI/AAAAAAAAYVM/9FXNNXjbCho/s1168-no/15%2B-%2B4&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be perfectly honest, I’m hoping in the near future to lose a little weight (and it’s been working). So this is kind of the start of what I’m eating. I’m trying to incorporate more and more vegetables, and less other things. But it’s a process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How are you eating? What are your usual go tos? What do you do when you life is super busy?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Weekend Recap</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-LYZ9oye3_2E/VP2tkhFOs1I/AAAAAAAAYGM/Vd7BfMWUkTo/w794-h500-p-k-no/IMG_7467.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such a busy weekend! I have so much to catch up on in the blog world like a tag from &lt;a href=&quot;http://acoupleofdashes.com/&quot;&gt;Tricia&lt;/a&gt;, like 8 posts from &lt;a href=&quot;http://girlytomboymusings.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;Stephanie, aka ganeeban :)&lt;/a&gt; and recipes from all over. But! J returned home this weekend, and work has been absolutely swamped, so I’m slowly shoveling my way out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This weekend, I started in Palo Alto for some retail therapy, and some acai. (It’s not a weekend anymore if I don’t at least try to consume acai.) I hit up &lt;a href=&quot;barebowls.com&quot;&gt;Bare Bowls&lt;/a&gt; and ate this delicious pitaya blend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HnzSfIsPBu8/VPuGMPmSoXI/AAAAAAAAYAg/gSHAF_6lXP4/s716-no/IMG_7447.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bare’s portion sizes are way more reasonable, albeit still expensive. But I didn’t feel like I was consuming acai the size of my head. (But I have, and I will) The only sad thing, is I felt really old at Bare because it was all adorable Stanford students out studying or coming in from their morning run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stopped at Anthropologie (to admire all the spring dresses) but also to pick up some bowls that were more portion friendly. I’ve been trying to snack lighter lately, but putting a serving of nuts in a soup bowl just makes me feel like I’m not eating anything. These guys are way better (and cuter).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/xZlBRN5Pq3L33wNrLAV8X2Ve-1Nm4YRfG3t98HzupoKV=w1028-h507-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I demoed them with a serving of pretzels. Perfect!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/QpqgwEQ77RqsRGu_tzc_KJUvAZMgi9ANXtUHr7H3wuA0=w677-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought a few more things from Lululemon and Athleta, but I’ll spare you the awkward dressing room selfies. I’m a lazy treadmill runner, and I hope that by buying outdoor running clothes, I commit to occasionally running outdoors. Ha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/K8aD-wWuHuOq1rYExxslHcuu9lryEUwqvirnXKuemzJ1=w810-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;The outdoors isn&amp;#39;t so bad.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I picked J up that afternoon and basically smothered him with love and questions, but mostly questions. He had a blast, skied the alps, ate his weight in jamon iberico, and partied more days in two weeks than we normally do in a year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning I was off to Alcatraz with friends. It’s one of the cooler tourist spots in SF, and we wanted to check out Ai Weiwei’s exhibit there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/CIPR0XIFiKCTidLYuNMj3H6LWlyoW6-zEHbeMbwR1caB=s716-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Creepy cool prison staircases.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ai Weiwei is an activist from China who was detained by the country for 82 days for his belief. While he’s not currently in prison, he can’t leave China, so these exhibits are made in his studio and then shipped and set up in locations he’ll never see nor visit by other artists. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Alcatraz exhibit places carefree, child-like items like kites and legos, in a normally dark, gloomy place like prison in order to contrast the pieces with their overall location. Multiple artworks feature other prisoners and dissidents prominently. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pqai-TkrDIc0pjS17M_P5BDTWcb5dMaXq-g0D73A43RI=s716-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;The eyes of this kite are the twitter symbol.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a beautiful and haunting exhibit, and it allowed us to check out parts of the prison I hadn’t seen before. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After ferrying back to SF, I walked to &lt;a href=&quot;http://almostgettingittogether.com/&quot;&gt;Cassie’s&lt;/a&gt; place to chat and drink a smoothie. It was a nice way to catch up, since I won’t see her this next weekend while I’m in Portland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How was your weekend? Do you shop often? Any one else go from treadmill running to outdoor running? &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>WIAW: Post Cleanse</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/CZ_EI7DYmsIn7jmbNHAWIl44g5B12hxjDsEU3Kvb1UyV=w794-h500-p-k-no&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yay! &lt;a href=&quot;http://peasandcrayons.com/2015/03/what-i-ate-wednesday-213.html&quot;&gt;WIAW&lt;/a&gt; is back!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to write today like it was the most delicious day ever, but that’s likely because it was the first day I ate after three days of juicing. Don’t get me wrong, the juice was great (and hey, I’m down 4 pounds [of mostly water weight]), but it’s nice to eat real food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to most cleanses, I did a terrible job eating after. I had a less than mediocre amount of vegetables, fruit, and light broths. But to me, today was great. I wasn’t craving things all day, and with my serious lack of cravings, I’ve been working on transitioning off diet soda. I felt wonderful, even if this isn’t what you should typically eat post cleanse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most unappetizing picture, but the most delicious breakfast. This was a sriracha, bacon, egg and cheese (on dutch crunch) sandwich with melon and apple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-x75SPperI7w/VPcpN4tSZ-I/AAAAAAAAX5o/Cj1PDgQG-os/s1023-no/15%2B-%2B2&quot; alt=&quot;breakfast&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lunch there was a BBQ pop-up. I grabbed flank steak, roasted broccoli and whatever the salad was. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/CZ_EI7DYmsIn7jmbNHAWIl44g5B12hxjDsEU3Kvb1UyV=w1023-h665-no&quot; alt=&quot;lunch&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I work at a magical place, where for no reason, someone will bring a skewer with tortellini, tomatoes, and cheese to your desk. It’s hard to say no to that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/lSa26mEWIuHLrtlPUkpCIokqhhJfXV6xK6tCSRpmGjnU=w838-h1402-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to regularly scheduled snacks. I had a handful of pistachios. The best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-pJzRLMaaQy4/VPcpN7et9DI/AAAAAAAAX50/Y0us7cFD0lE/w1023-h1364-no/15%2B-%2B5&quot; alt=&quot;snack 1 pistachios&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then later on some beef jerky. I love Fieldtrip a lot. I used to eat a lot of Krave Jerky, until my boyfriend pointed out it had more sugar than protein. Woops. Now I grab this guy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/iIVi3C50voiHfflX2t2nDj93OB_u2OlThXPNpKRPqB5-=w1023-h1107-no&quot; alt=&quot;snack two beef jerky&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went on a run in the evening, so I wasn’t very hungry at dinner. I went home and watched the Bachelor Girls Tell All episode. (Guys, I’m so team Whitney. Sorry, not sorry.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Literally 10 minutes before bed my stomach rumbled. So I grabbed a handful of “Pressels” a baked pretzel chip thingy I bought at whole foods on a whim. They’re a great snack that doesn’t make me want to immediately eat the entire bag. Yay for portionable things! And yay for the cutest chip clip ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ffxLDTlT7jo5CX6GbYISHVvu4P44cqGUfBSrCCmKTAi4=w1023-h1251-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What have you been eating lately? Are you watching the Bachelor? (I am the least big fan of Chris Soules, but I love (almost) all the girls this season.)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Morning musings</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-iM78VzcyVqo/VPXenk9fg_I/AAAAAAAAX00/VB1mySzQsNY/w794-h500-c-k-no/IMG_7396.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With J gone for a few weeks (although, I got him to change his flight and come home earlier!!!), my schedule has been a little shaken up. Normally, we wake up around 8, maybe 9, and stumble on a bus, or a bike all the way into work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lately, I’ve been waking up at 5-6 a.m., and it’s amazing. I’m in love with the early morning, and I’ve been walking to work. (partially because my bike is in the shop, partially because I prefer walking.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s fun to shake up your schedule, and I love that walking makes me feel more energized throughout the day. This morning I snapped a bunch of pictures along my way, so you could see my morning walk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-7CnDhwX-RRw/VPXcOBtRq3I/AAAAAAAAX0Y/XYcPVyjW5nA/s1023-no/IMG_7394.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;A lonely Google bike left on the side of the road.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a little chilly in the mornings, early to mid 40s. But it’s nothing a sweater can’t handle. (Sorry cold parts of the world.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I leave before 7 a.m., all the little kids are biking to school, and it’s adorable to see parades of kids on little, neon-colored bikes. However, I have morals, I think it’s weird to snap pictures of unassuming kids and post them on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/1_XgkHSqFYv80hHfOj3QpvYYk3cBJm51lxCvp5ZSdHJP=w1023-h1159-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;So you get flowers instead.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This and a coffee is really the perfect way to wake up in the morning. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you wake up? Do you pass anything great on your way to work? &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Suja Original Fresh Start Program Review</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/wE22qzMU1OS0L52a6y5tMcfpfquPKILe4qC7S48jrUMC=h500-w794-c-k-no&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, I’m on the third day of a 3 day cleanse from Suja. But having made it through most of the way, I figured I’m now qualified to show you what a day in the life of my cleanse looked like, and weigh in on what I loved, hated, and everything inbetween.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For direct numbers, the Original Fresh Start is 6 juices a day, 3 green, two “root” and one nut milk. It clocks in at 1060 calories, so low, but not excessively. It expects you start the juices an hour or two after you wake up, and finish 3 hours before bed.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every morning starts the same with a mug of hot water, with a capful of apple cider vinegar, and a squeeze of lemon. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/0ZGrIYlBunM7Z-FZEsqT-K6yxYTZsZ3t4ZAHFBdJOyEq=w1023-h1085-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is by and large my least favorite part of the day, and unfortunately, something I’ll probably take from the cleanse. I’m not convinced that warm lemon and apple cider vinegar is some miracle drink for weight loss, or health. But the potential for benefit outweighs the 3 terrible minutes of drinking this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breakfast:&lt;/strong&gt; aka Glow. It’s a green juice, but is mostly apple-y to me. It’s easy to drink and low calorie. It’s a nice way to stop the morning after that terrible ACV-lemon combo. I usually started drinking this around 9 am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/kHqBaG5UX6AAzrhjaO6v2P4BefDyQiX3xmP3yb8KlVOo=w1023-h1252-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mid-morning Snack:&lt;/strong&gt; is Fuel, although honestly. It’s not one of those things I feel fueled by, however it is delicious. Carrot heavy with apple, pineapple and lemon. 11 am is a hard time for me, so this is a nice juice to snack on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/SinCVgv5sm7NXviIIubmyUNSrLUNy4iZMi72AX8mHz-7=w1023-h1221-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lunch:&lt;/strong&gt; Purify. A seriously beet-y juice. It’s also really delicious, but I wish I had a more greens heavy juice in the morning. All three of the above juices clock under 100 calories per 8 oz serving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Kr0-QQ70BBtrl0Co-Jeb43riv9L5_jCKyFHxHMtd9s2w=w1023-h1213-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Midafternoon Snack&lt;/strong&gt;: Fiji. It’s very very similar to me to Glow. But I’m happy for the greens. This one only has a handful of leaves and is light from the celery and cucumber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-3tmccTm95zg/VPSB_7Jt3-I/AAAAAAAAXrc/vEyXvp85TAw/w1023-h1364-no/15%2B-%2B6&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dinner:&lt;/strong&gt; Be still my heart. It’s Green Supreme. This is by far my favorite Suja juice from this set. And honestly, if I kept drinking any juice it would be this bad boy. He’s a lemon, kale and apple hybrid. But the kale is potent in this drink. This juice makes you feel healthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-sqfwlrJQwgU/VPSB_7EFBJI/AAAAAAAAXrQ/7AL646_bSgw/s1023-no/15%2B-%2B7&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dessert:&lt;/strong&gt; Every review I’ve read tells you how much they love and look forward to the nut milk drink at the end of the night. And I’m here to end that. I didn’t love it. It was gritty, and not that creamy. It’s not unappealing, it’s just not anywhere near as good to me, as any of their other juices. If I was doing this cleanse again. I’d feign a nut allergy and double up on another juice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/B6gDpwogpLng7McjHqUb3rFTF6vp_O75fD2BjP9K4LIF=w1023-h1142-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My only other indulgence? Caffeine free tea. I don’t like flowery herbals, so this rooibos chai has been great for someone who loves black coffee and dark heavy teas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/niBmtNxt8rNpSDBCuaHLh41OL1Arb41GknugGfABduCn=w1023-h1051-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I’ve got a lot of love for this cleanse. It’s my first, and honestly, it was pretty easy. I think the level of calories kept me satiated. The juices were fun to drink (but definitely taste healthy. This is no Welchs or Tropicana) and honestly, I felt very hydrated and I’m pretending my skin looks better, so I feel good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also think 3 days is basically the perfect amount of time to juice. I had a relaxing weekend, and you’re pretty dependent on the juice schedule, so it’s really key to be able to stick to a plan. For most people this would be great at work, but for me, it’s kind of embarrassing. Food is provided at work, and most of my coworkers are men who have never even heard of a cleanse. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do the work thing, I got a cute igloo lunchbox and buried four of my juices in it. It’s been great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/om_6CvoiX8zVDJo0-qGlwElSfQXyEmzAMduVyxRvBqFK=w1023-h912-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The hardest part:&lt;/strong&gt; For me? No coffee. I drink a large cup of black coffee every morning at the same time. And so to go without any caffeine left me with crazy strong headaches the first morning. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The best part:&lt;/strong&gt; Not thinking about food all the time. It’s a little bit bizarre, though I knew I was doing a cleanse, I’d have these momentary “Indian food sounds really good for dinner” or “I should eat some bean chips before they go stale.” Even though I knew I was doing a juice cleanse, I thought about food. Which showed me how much of my day I spend with food on my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will I do it again? Probably yeah. Another time J’s out of town, or before my brother’s wedding. The Core Fresh Start by Suja is more intense and I’d love to try it because this was relatively easy for me to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you juiced? Do you drink green juices often? Is there a way to make apple cider vinegar suck less? :)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>WIAW - Vegan before a Cleanse</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/CDeKZc5oMPB2SR6qDkmRXZL6CEIo0cbBXzP1UGkrNmyt=w794-h500-no&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between you and me, I’ve never done a juice cleanse before. I like eating, and I’m not always a fan of how juice cleanses are marketed. I think my liver does a fine job of getting rid of toxins, and I’m not sure I really need to detox anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, I have wanted to try one, with a juice bar on every corner in SF, it’s hard to not wonder. And I don’t think my metabolism, and body are so fragile that 3 days of 1200 calories in juice will hurt much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cleanses are kind of expensive (even with the deal I used), and so I wanted to do it “right”. So this whole week I’ve been eating vegan, and getting progressively more restrictive with my diet. The makers suggest “you cut out alcohol, processed foods, excess salt, white flour and bread products, and refined sugar a day or two before the program and load up on fresh fruits and veggies.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Bpl8pAQtyQDPfkk6Eo-5t-sw0yZp_tCq13IGK3yMLkYo=s1023-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For breakfast I made some coconut chia seed pudding (coconut milk, chia seeds, a drop of agave), and sprinkled a bit of this granola on for crunch. Delicious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-9U7954KSTq8/VO3mJkm1N7I/AAAAAAAAXfg/uOvZMDLg2A8/w1022-h767-no/IMG_7300.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lazy lunch. A veggie sandwich with spinach, onion, tomato, avocado and mustard. And a tofu and tomato soup. I’m lucky that work labels all their vegan options, but man, it’s kind of difficult to find things that don’t feel like sides. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-fAteehmqwSU/VO3mKEjiZXI/AAAAAAAAXfg/G9zLuilI6_k/w1023-h767-no/IMG_7299.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Post lunch snack of coconut chips, and hot tea. I’ve been drinking a lot of herbal tea during this in order to cut down my carbonated beverages problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/FqGghkNq0zOSvryeynP5uWPEqfR8jNBAv4VJ4qdKTb6N=w1023-h1165-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Desk picture of these super delicious bean chips. They’re very reminiscent of doritos, complete with seasoning that ends up all over your hands. I really loved them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bqsfjeWsL9gNhpQY6FzR_ExSJ8KkRjMnsLUqg7_vs6Mp=w1023-h994-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Black bean brownie bites I made from &lt;a href=&quot;http://minimalistbaker.com/vegan-gluten-free-black-bean-brownies/&quot;&gt;this recipe&lt;/a&gt; but with coconut sugar instead of raw cane. I added the sprinkles when photographing otherwise they look like bean hockey pucks. They’re good, but they definitely taste “healthy”. Whenever people tell me their friends can’t tell the difference, I always wonder if they have really polite, or really healthy friends. I’d eat these at home, but I wouldn’t bring them to a party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unpictured are the handful of cashews I snarfed. I had a hard time with vegan food this time. I’m used to a lot of protein, and I think not having easy options for protein made me ravenous and freezing cold all day. I paired a small dish of the chia seed pudding with a brownie this morning for breakfast and feel much better. So I&amp;#39;m just aiming to eat more beans, nuts and tofu today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s fun to try vegan, especially while J isn’t around. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you tried a cleanse? What vegan food should I try out?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Plan Active Vacations</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-cC2m0SMk-Vw/U9qt-Gst-gI/AAAAAAAABQ4/MsJAbsYqR-A/w794-h500-c-k-no/IMG_0376.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No secret here, I spend a lot of time on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/flights/&quot;&gt;Google Flight Search&lt;/a&gt; trying to find good weekend getaways. I enjoy a nice weekend at home, but if there’s the chance I can take a roadtrip, or hop a plane out of town, I’m the first to do it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons I’ve been search, is my birthday is coming up, and J and I are heading north to Portland for the weekend. I realized, aside from planning to literally drown myself in coffee, most of the things I want to do are food related. So in order to minimize the damage, I’ve been thinking of how to keep active on vacation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;1. Walk everywhere (if you can!)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a huge proponent of walking. If it’s safe out, and I can budget the time, I always try to walk. When my sister and I were in Vegas, we explored all of the Strip, and inside a bunch of stores. Climbing 6 flights of stairs was worth both the steps, and the fun we had posing with M&amp;amp;Ms. Indoor or outdoor walking are both great ways to stay active. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-WvCWR4jDo2Q/VON-ysQdaZI/AAAAAAAAWwM/kF-89B0Nbq8/w1023-h767-no/IMG_7039.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;2. Rent a bike, or go on a run to explore the city&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of our plans in Portland is to bike around town, but we’ve also loved biking in Hawaii, San Francisco, Monterey, and Boston. It’s a great way to see most of the city in a short amount of time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-pIDiOrNwYX8/VOyTsek3wiI/AAAAAAAAXcE/TtUfT5kVi58/w403-h716-no/bikehawaii.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;3. Try Yelp for other extreme adventures. &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One weekend we went to Tahoe and found an extreme high ropes course. After two days of hiking this was a great way to mix it up. I love paddleboarding, beachfront yoga, and trampoline gyms when I’m away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-1q9RdCoUSVg/U-KnWYI_lRI/AAAAAAAAEjI/w5wCHhha_L4/w1023-h1364-no/IMG_1708.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;4. Find a nearby hike&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of my favorites. J and I actually spent 3 weeks getting from NYC to San Francisco by car because during the whole trip we kept stopping and hiking at every National park on our way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/--dBE0douIa4/U9rLNnZ1szI/AAAAAAAATmg/kYTH6uOfKSw/w1023-h767-no/IMG_0476.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Angels Landing is the best hike of all time.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;5. Take a local class.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love finding new classes in other cities, and with so many deals for your first class, or first week, it can be really budget friendly to take a class on vacation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are your favorite vacations? Do you stay active? Any tips? (Also what should I do in Portland that I’m missing. We only have two full days in Portland itself.) &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Weekend Recap - How I walked San Francisco</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-q3U1DwVIJ_M/VOsv8SG06jI/AAAAAAAAXSc/-E1tFuR-uyE/w794-h500-p-k-no/IMG_7240.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the weather around the world, I feel a little guilty posting this weekend recap. My pictures will give away the temperature out in Northern California. It was around 65 degrees, and a hot 65 at that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to tell you how beautiful it was to walk around all week, but given that everyone else I know has sidewalks covered in ice. I’ll let the pictures do the talking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning I headed down to the Embarcadero, to check out the farmers market. It’s in my opinion the best farmers market in the city, albeit a little crowded by 10 a.m. One of the big draws is the fact that they have multiple street food vendors, and so it’s a great place to come grab brunch, and some cheap, delicious fruit too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Kzl8t_LfhtU/VOswC8bO4mI/AAAAAAAAXTk/YbpJgDyeZ0A/w1023-h767-no/IMG_7246.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Flowers from the farmers market&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I’m excited to have a lot of free time since J is gone for the next few weeks, I also was worried that that might manifest itself into me just hiding at home because “it’s not worth going out” or “I don’t want to eat alone” or “I don’t know what to do.” So one of my goals was to stay out of the house as much as possible. After leaving the farmers market I stopped for a tea at Starbucks (it was 8 a.m., and a little chilly for me)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-qmhguE_QIfY/VOsvvDsxz1I/AAAAAAAAXQ0/2x1UO5ksHZI/w1023-h1364-no/IMG_7231.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent a lot of time walking around, perusing stores. Did you know San Francisco has a Neiman Marcus Last Call? It’s kind of like the Nordstrom’s Rack for Neiman Marcus, or the inbetween of store and outlet. It’s beautiful, has gorgeous designer gear, and ugh. I almost caved to a pair of Frye boots marked down from $430 to $185, but then I realized money doesn’t grow on trees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lunch was calling me, so I headed to Basik. Acai in San Francisco is a dangerous thing. I tried to go twice this weekend, it was sold out by noon on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-0VyDXs7lTp4/VOswQOK8xjI/AAAAAAAAXV0/rILg88OT5eQ/s1023-no/IMG_7270.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the evening I met up with a friend to play bocce at a bar. I totally forgot that bocce is fun, and I was actually passably good at it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunday morning I grabbed brunch with friends. I was so busy chatting I didn’t even remember to snap a picture. After hanging out with them for awhile, I went walking again. I actually ended up walking over 23 miles between Saturday and Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a lot of walking, I was really feeling a smoothie, so I stopped at &lt;a href=&quot;http://earthbar.com/&quot;&gt;Earth Bar&lt;/a&gt; and grabbed their Miami Beach. It was really light and refreshing, it’s made of Pineapple, Papaya, Banana, &amp;amp; Coconut Water, so it was a nice way to rehydrate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/P2HYvmPzZ4KdyfjCUjyERmw7zlu-WTul8ArTWJS4i_E0=w1023-h1364-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later in the evening, I met up with &lt;a href=&quot;http://almostgettingittogether.com/&quot;&gt;Cassie&lt;/a&gt; for my first ever SoulCycle class, found out I can sweat even more than I thought I could, and ate a great homemade dinner (thanks girl). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a weekend like that, I don’t really want to go to work today. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How was your weekend? Did you try anything new?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Friday Faves - iPhone Photo Editing</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/baLbqbhWLAI6HZBYqaKZP3X4Sn3T5ltgHRH6kr5TiShO=w794-h500-p-k-no&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I openly love to take in flight shots. Although, since I’m almost always leaving California, and flying east, they all have looked like that lately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of photos, I wanted to chat about some of the photo editing stuff I love. I am admittedly, still strapped to my iPhone for most blog pictures. But why make a bad thing worse? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My most recent fave is definitely &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/app/darkroom-by-bergen/id953286746&quot;&gt;Darkroom - photo editor&lt;/a&gt; an app that mimics the best Lightroom features for your iPhone. Full disclosure, one of the founders is a friend. (However, I paid for the app, so.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But believe you me, I’m not the only one who thinks it’s the best, it has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theverge.com/2015/2/12/8025141/best-photo-editing-app-darkroom-iphone&quot;&gt;rave&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://petapixel.com/2015/02/12/darkroom-ios-photo-editing-app-diy-filters-curves-infinite-history/&quot;&gt;reviews&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cultofmac.com/312063/darkroom-like-best-adobe-lightroom-iphone/&quot;&gt;from&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.popphoto.com/news/2015/02/new-app-darkroom-photo-editor-ios&quot;&gt;multiple&lt;/a&gt; publications (including the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/19/technology/personaltech/tools-to-make-meetings-more-productive-and-maybe-more-pleasant.html?_r=0&quot;&gt;NYTimes&lt;/a&gt;) and appeared as one of Apple’s best new apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-_Aydp3Ebu04/VOdYO1bJEsI/AAAAAAAAXOM/UkRQ8jSFD40/w403-h715-no/IMG_7225.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And within each image you can adjust the curves, use filters, and more importantly create preset filters for yourself. I’ve heard, although I don’t know much, that it’s similar to vscocam, but more customization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of the following images went through Darkroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/0IJFKvzTpF2GE3nDqwgHbLKjOilAxj8eA-kSpRazlZ7y=w1040-h703-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not super knowledgeable about photo editing, but I’ve never had a moment using it where I felt like the unedited picture looked better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/wjHypFFop_3I1GKYT89JAAwctFpZKjyr0lbK6qL0f8i5=w1039-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally in the realm of photography, I back up all my phone pictures to Google+. This is two fold, one because I’m biased towards the Goog. But two, because I actually think account security, and photo editing are way better in G+. Aka. My photos aren’t going to be leaked in some celebrity nude-gate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;G+ has a feature called “Auto Awesome” which tries to analyze photos and figure out how to improve them. This can be anything from looking at a series of similar photos and building one where everyone is smiling, to making collages out of photos that historically go together. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of time, computers and algorithms are naive, and so it’s often an “Auto Awful” more than an “Auto Awesome”. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-nw0ElTpK95E/VKVy6hhW2lI/AAAAAAAASvY/umP2RYhI4ns/w953-h716-no/IMG_5784-MOTION.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;More awful, or awesome?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But recently I got this gorgeous pano from my Vegas photos. It&amp;#39;s a lot more striking larger, but I love good panoramas!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-vau9-UTx6HI/VOOGQZsh8VI/AAAAAAAAXMM/8J4ZVfKrgkQ/w1041-h374-no/IMG_7140-PANO.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last but not least. The cutest Valentines Day food ever. This guacamole. I didn’t spend good old V-day with J. (although he did get me the cutest card, and gifts). But at least I spent it with the next best thing. Avocados. (oh, and my sister).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-vwD4wIZtXtw/VOOEpQnVo4I/AAAAAAAAXB0/IDWmP86cy8I/s672-no/IMG_7179.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;valentines day guacamole&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are your favorite things lately? Any photo tricks that you use? &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Thinking Out Loud - What to do when the boyfriend’s away?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-YLpt07JEWDc/VB-ogI31ggI/AAAAAAAAMrg/tX-22klGV2w/w794-h500-p-k-no/IMG_0711.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J is leaving this morning on a round the world (okay, round the Europe) tour for work, which means I’m boyfriend-less for 18 days. While I’m sad (no cuddling for 18 days!) I’ve also been trying to think about, plan and fit in all the things that are better J-less:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;- Eating a lot of healthy and/or vegan food.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
J is one of those people who, whenever a recipe says “Your boyfriend/friends/whatever won’t be able to tell the difference from the real thing” I know the recipe writer hasn’t met my boyfriend. He’s not easily swayed by black bean brownies, or tofu mousse. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-xtckJoAjNhc/VMXtbycCoKI/AAAAAAAAUcY/pUCfBCa8eTo/s716-no/IMG_6355.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;- Going to bed at 10 pm.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
J and I have a sweet bedtime compromise. I’d love to go to sleep at 10 p.m. and wake up at 6 a.m.. And J would love to rock a 3 a.m. to noon type schedule. So usually we fall asleep between 11 p.m. and 12 a.m. and get up between 8-9 a.m. While J’s away, my bedtime is going to be grandma level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;- Hit up some new exercise classes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 Usually, J and I opt for hikes, or long bike rides when we’re together. But with him gone, I plan on trying some new things. Cardio barre, or contemporary dance anyone? :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-H2XxbP4p3J8/VGAsgPYLe6I/AAAAAAAANy0/k86C2vFvROY/w955-h716-no/IMG_0469.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;More surfset. Yes please!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;- Catching up on bad TV.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
J is not a fan of the bachelor, or Scandal, or How to Get Away with Murder, or Are You the One? So while he’s gone I hope to binge on trashy wonderful TV. As long as it’s the only thing I binge on, I’ll consider it a win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Jkyi2vHZ238/VGLUAF7AYEI/AAAAAAAAN_A/LirwvwjHfNs/s716-no/IMG_4463.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;This bowl of popcorn is the only one who will watch Chris Soules with me.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;- Become a laundry tornado.&lt;/strong&gt; 
Since we’ve just deep cleaned both our apartments, I’ve been trying to keep my clothes orderly. But left to my own devices, I am kind of a mess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s good to get my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.runningwithspoons.com/2015/02/19/thinking-out-loud-118/&quot;&gt;thoughts outloud&lt;/a&gt;, and while I’m a little insecure about having a month without J around. (Am I destined to eat every meal alone? What happens if I lock myself out? etc) I’m hoping that by putting this out there, I get a lot done, rather than getting depressed and becoming a total recluse. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Waking up in Vegas</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-1a3yk67B2tU/VON95bIk7lI/AAAAAAAAWs0/q4HQxuP4jBY/h500-w794-p-k-no/IMG_7024.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey all. Sorry I’ve been so MIA. I spent the weekend with my sister in Vegas watching the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usasevens.com/las-vegas/&quot;&gt;USA Rugby Sevens&lt;/a&gt;. Embarrassingly, this international tournament is the first time I’ve actually watched rugby, despite the fact that my sister has played it for almost 4 years now. (Yes. I am really the worst.) But we had a lot of fun, the seats were amazing, and the games were great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-mRRj5Oxx0-A/VOOE02-R8mI/AAAAAAAAXFA/JRHdyDpX5FE/w1041-h604-no/IMG_7191.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;photo of me at the field&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Christmas, I shelled out for seats right behind the try (the goal posts) and we watched with some of the biggest fans in Rugby. The row of gentlemen behind us were ex-pats from England, and I basically fell in love with them for their cheers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anything was good it was “Get it lads!” or if one of the England players missed a pass, “Oh what a muppet!” and when France played England I heard choruses of “The only reason France plays Rugby is for another excuse to wear Spandex.” or “No wonder France is trying Rugby, they don’t have anything they’re good at anymore now that California makes the best wines.” The kid sister and I couldn’t keep from cracking up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-tNz7Zw-bI3M/VOOCxcGAijI/AAAAAAAAW6Q/6-yzouNKa5Y/w955-h716-no/IMG_7138.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;photo of the sister at the field&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;My sister and I look a lot alike.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stayed at the team hotel, so we were constantly surrounded by giant rugby players. In the casino, at the bar, in the pool. It was a blast to feel like part of the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-br067BSLe6o/VOOE7Yl_DtI/AAAAAAAAXFU/Abyfizi486A/w537-h716-no/IMG_7197.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;photo of drink at field&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;The meaning of rugby. Alcohol and the Pitch.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made our way around Vegas in the two days we had off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-wTybrPrJGGk/VOODN4gI_oI/AAAAAAAAW9A/YnQkmI_ugSg/w953-h716-no/IMG_7053-MOTION.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My suggestions? Drink all the novelty drinks. Explore all the stores. Walk the strip about 100 times. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-hbwqcV9d8K0/VON-_BJrWiI/AAAAAAAAWxg/meyPhQEFqgA/w537-h716-no/IMG_7046.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My secret though? I’m terrible at Vegas. I’m not much for gambling, clubbing, smoking, or strippers. I like keeping my money, and that’s hard to do in Vegas. To be fair, we couldn’t stay out very late, because in order to get the best seats, we had to be at the field at 8 am. It was fun to visit for a weekend, but I would have been pretty bored if we were there much longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-aFt9ZSi-ylk/VON9c_IKZ3I/AAAAAAAAWp8/aXp9lnHa2G0/w955-h716-no/IMG_7005.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you been to Vegas before? What’s the most obscure sport you follow? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’m catching up on all my blogs this week after having no service for five days. Sorry if I kill you with comments, likes, or love.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Sex Kitten Salad: an early morning time saver.</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/NJGOkH-2s10TMPZ6g1etyl6TKeOOQiXI7cAqXb3-s8T7=w794-h500-c-k-no&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time you read this, I’ll already be on a 6 am flight to Vegas. My sister are headed out there to visit cupcake ATMs, walk the Strip, and most importantly watch the Rugby Sevens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week has been crazy, and SFO airport is honestly one of the saddest airports when it comes to food. More than that, I’ve always been one of those people who likes waking up early in the morning, but hates doing things early in the morning. Let’s be real, when I’m up at 5 am, my first thought isn’t what gourmet breakfast I’m going to cook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is why, I’ve been making the Sex Kitten Salad, from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/The-Skinny-Confidential-Health-Lifestyle/dp/1624140459&quot;&gt;The Skinny Confidential’s new book&lt;/a&gt;. (Ask me about all the recipes I’m trying from it!) I&amp;#39;ve been following &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/&quot;&gt;Lauryn Evarts&lt;/a&gt; for an embarrasssingly long amount of time, she opened me to the world of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/2014/04/23/shaving-face-but-women/&quot;&gt;shaving your face&lt;/a&gt;, makes me want to improve my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/2014/06/08/traveling-essentials-ramblings/&quot;&gt;travel essentials&lt;/a&gt;, and keeps me envying her killer style with her &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/2011/10/22/mini-delites-5/&quot;&gt;mini delites&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Ri1LVFeHB1M/VNxk40JJFKI/AAAAAAAAWbM/OzUZ1Xdy-do/w933-h716-no/15%2B-%2B2&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This simple fruit salad is easy to customize, develops even more flavor overnight, and can be made with things you likely even have in your fridge. And with the leftovers, you can rock some of The Skinny Confidential’s, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/2014/10/16/busy-deal-5-chia-seed-jam/&quot;&gt;5 second chia seed jam&lt;/a&gt;. (In blueberry instead of raspberry, natch).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-4ZCQ1DeG4YY/VNxk4w-2L6I/AAAAAAAAWbA/8MFc1761Ix4/w504-h672-no/15%2B-%2B6&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Serves 1.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(but you should make more, because trust me, everyone’s gonna want some)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ingredients&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
1 handful of strawberries, sliced&lt;br&gt;
1 handful of blueberries&lt;br&gt;
4 hefty pineapple wedges, chopped&lt;br&gt;
1 kiwi, skinned and diced&lt;br&gt;
4 tbsp/30 g Greek yogurt&lt;br&gt;
2 tbsp/20 g chia seeds  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spices&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Cinnamon, to taste&lt;br&gt;
Pumpkin pie spice, to taste&lt;br&gt;
Nutmeg, to taste&lt;br&gt;
Optional: fresh mint leaves  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Directions&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(So basic, I shouldn&amp;#39;t even have to tell you.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Combine all ingredients in a large bowl and toss lightly. Add extra spices on top. Garnish 
with mint (optional).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I layered mine parfait style, I think this would look lovely served over yogurt in a glass bowl, or laid out by fruit type on a tray for brunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been a welcome change from my bagged eggs for breakfast, and I might try it with coconut cream instead of yogurt for a paleo twist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s your speed breakfast? How do you save time in the morning?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I was sent “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/The-Skinny-Confidential-Health-Lifestyle/dp/1624140459&quot;&gt;The Skinny Confidential: A Babe&amp;#39;s Sexy, Sassy Health and Lifestyle Guide”&lt;/a&gt; but, I’ve actually been eating my weight in this salad, so all opinions are my own.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>WIAW, Intuitive Eating</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/VFMNH3dAP9dITlQQqXHahAv7tkaMEpCj5tWtU_RvwcZi=w794-h500-c-k-no&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s one of those weeks where &lt;a href=&quot;//www.peasandcrayons.com&quot;&gt;Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; feels like Friday. Probably because I’m hopping a plane to Vegas tomorrow. Intuitive eating was the perfect eating experience to try to embody on a day where I felt like I had to micromanage every other aspect of my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While actual intuitive eating has a lot of components, and is much more than a day’s effort, I wanted to see how I would do if I just let myself eat when I decided I needed to. Each thing I ate will talk about how I felt about eating it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Breakfast started a little different. I had two cranberry vegan pancakes, and decidedly non-vegan eggs. I walked to work this morning, and as someone who experiences morning hunger without even moving, I was pretty hungry when I got in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/zEN_PEetcHlawpimCKGbyl25zvvnwTHIdq7KdfIKJzca=w955-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How I felt: I had just walked two miles to work, I probably should have waited 15 minutes for my stomach to settle a bit more before eating to better gauge my hunger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lunch I didn’t have a lot of choice in, my coworkers and I eat together every day around noon. So even though I started feeling a little hungry at 11:30, this was the one meal I couldn’t go intuitive on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stopped at a bbq food truck, where I grabbed flank steak, whole wheat pasta with tomato and spinach, and a whole bunch of roasted broccoli.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/VFMNH3dAP9dITlQQqXHahAv7tkaMEpCj5tWtU_RvwcZi=w966-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How I felt: I was definitely ready to eat by the time this came around, and I felt pretty nourished by this plate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had ⅓ of an apple fritter. A coworker came around with treats for his birthday, and two of my teammates and I split one. There’s no picture because I stood in a huge group, drinking coffee and celebrating a friend’s achievements. Sometimes, you can’t always snap what you ate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How I felt: This was celebration food. I definitely wasn’t hungry at this point, but I didn’t indulge in an entire dessert myself, and it was the right move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grabbed another snack later in the day. Work has been stocking these bars, and they’re pretty much like healthy candy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-MQlh0FAWbFw/VNr4O_2LOrI/AAAAAAAAWQM/Rbi3PSW_uD4/w538-h716-no/15%2B-%2B1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How I felt: Honestly. I think I just grabbed one of these to have an excuse to get up from my desk. I love these, but I wasn’t hungry when I ate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went for a run, biked home, and then J and I spent the evening cleaning. At the end of the night after a bunch of sweat, bleach, and exhaustion, I just wasn’t hungry. I grabbed a handful of See’s Hot Hearts. (These are like the best Hot Tamales I’ve ever had, and cinnamon candy is difficult for me to go overboard on.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/p786qXmuxPlSNHPNp_prnJA4qJCz2RB_lMWUjXDS6Mf3=s716-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Please enjoy my kitchen tile, straight from the 70s.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How I felt: I probably didn’t need these, I was mostly tired, not very hungry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I’m better at identifying food I am hungry for, and food I’m craving than I give myself credit for. I definitely ate a bunch of sugary things today, more than I usually shoot for, but overall it wasn’t terrible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d love to eventually transition over to a more intuitive style of eating, but right now, I do live, and like living with some food rules. So we’ll see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you eat intuitively? What’s the best thing you ate recently?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Making big purchases.</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-fASEEOL48T8/U-J_L-60QaI/AAAAAAAACw4/bEf4Gk55-9g/w794-h500-p-k-no/IMG_1078.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I won’t lie, I’m someone who often employs retail therapy to make myself feel better. I love buying a box of new granola bars, or finding a cute candle or buying a new subscription box on an impulse. And, while I have a general budget, I do let myself roam pretty freely with small purchases. If I see something cute on etsy under 50 dollars, chances are, I’ll eventually buy it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when it comes to big purchases, for some reason it seems much more serious to me. I could buy ten, $10 products in a week, but one pair of $98 lululemon yoga pants makes me reconsider. Because of this, it can take me weeks to finally pull the trigger on expensive purchases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I look back to my time in San Francisco. There are two major purchases I’ve made, and today I made another. I wanted to look back and see if they were worth the weeks of deliberation I put myself through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first big ticket item I bought was my bike. J and I actually bought our bikes together. We had dreams of long scenic rides on the weekends, and fast trips throughout the city. We agonized over whether we should go road, mountain, or hybrid. We eventually both bought road bikes and it was like buying my first car all over again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-d77wl8Ge6mg/VL1q1UftRwI/AAAAAAAAUDM/iIzCFPSZTb8/w955-h716-no/IMG_6251.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, in terms of miles, the bikes have paid themselves off easily. I don’t own a car, and so I can either, bike, walk, or take an uber into work. Self powering my commute saves me ~12 dollars a day, and makes me more awake, alert, and happy. I love my Cannondale, and even after trying a more comfortable commuter bike, still want to stick with my baby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next year, my big purchase was my Canon EOS 7D. I had been wanting to take better pictures, and blog better pictures for awhile. I have quite a few friends who do photo walks, and always have gorgeous photos they’ve edited on Facebook. I researched for awhile to find an intermediate camera, and finally bit the bullet and bought this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-mO8AEUfx460/U-Kfv1qCDTI/AAAAAAAAD84/jVfuJE-dzIk/w477-h716-no/IMG_1502.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;The only photo I took of the camera.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It takes amazing pictures, even on auto. The first day it came in J and I did a pretty serious unboxing and started taking pictures around the house. It was like Christmas Day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-_mq-pF2JxfI/U3BPIPBSgMI/AAAAAAAAATw/jQliA7AIlGc/w477-h716-no/IMG_0003.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;One of the first photos I took with the 7D.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I feel a little guilty on this one. I still don’t know how to really use my camera. And when J leaves for a month of work trips, I plan on really improving this area so that I can better utilize this baby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to today. I had a Fitbit Force for the past year, and it finally broke from all the love and miles I put on it. In the past few weeks, I’ve been surprised at how much I missed step tracking, as a traditional office worker, it’s a really strong barometer for how my activity levels have been. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a lot of consideration. I purchased the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fitbit.com/surge&quot;&gt;Fitbit Surge&lt;/a&gt;. I’m super excited about the new features, but it’s definitely taken me almost a month to get on board with buying it. It’s being delivered today, so I’ll let you know how I like it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://static1.fitbit.com/simple.b-cssdisabled-jpg.h9bce7fcfed9187568cb88a34fd17d7f5.pack?items=%2Fcontent%2Fassets%2Fsurge%2Fimages%2Fgallery%2Fgallery-07.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;I loved the orange, but went with black.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s the last big purchase you made? Do you think a lot of about big purchases, or small ones?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A weekend of food, wine, and friends.</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-y390QO4OKmw/VNcBf64ibUI/AAAAAAAAWCg/HcYYii1F9o0/w794-h500-p-k-no/15%2B-%2B5&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This weekend, to embrace the storms in SF, J went up to Tahoe in hopes of good snow, and I stayed in the city to meet &lt;a href=&quot;http://nuttyforlife.com/&quot;&gt;Angela&lt;/a&gt;, who was in visiting &lt;a href=&quot;//www.almostgettingittogether.com&quot;&gt;Cassie&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I enjoy time with J, there’s something refreshing about spending a weekend with people who want to take pictures of everything, always order a salad, and actually enjoy beets. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I met up with Cass and Ange at &lt;a href=&quot;http://kinkhao.com/&quot;&gt;Kin Khao&lt;/a&gt;, a super cute Thai place downtown. Turns out it’s on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.michelintravel.com/selections/2015-san-francisco-michelin-selections/&quot;&gt;Michelin Recommended list&lt;/a&gt; (always a great way to find restaurants), and it definitely lived up to its recommendation. The food was amazing, the curry was potent, and the vegetables speak for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-jH7AcjnA6W0/VNcBfwa7vQI/AAAAAAAAWCI/yKwJg6f4JeI/w537-h716-no/15%2B-%2B8&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;I could live on Kin Khao’s brussel sprouts.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning we were off to Napa. We hit up &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scribewinery.com/&quot;&gt;Scribe&lt;/a&gt;, an artisinal winery and vineyard in Sonoma, which is probably my new favorite winery of all time. If you go, you’ll fall in love with the land, the wine, and your sommelier. I know we did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-A_4FxzUOuVU/VNjoMhjR3GI/AAAAAAAAWGA/ezjitnSQS3s/w955-h716-no/15%2B-%2B5&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;A lot of the day looked like this.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weather behaved and we ended up having a beautiful sunny morning at Scribe. Drinking in both the view, and the varietals, there’s so much to talk about that I have to save Scribe for it’s own post. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/UutUv1tteHVC5G9HtwWdEOBfNVafJ65bnbBtLYEIfu22=w1041-h630-no&quot; alt=&quot;Girls at Scribe&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything on Saturday was really low key, so no one was bothered as I climbed on a bench to snap a quick photo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-tDU3-YOL3N4/VNbyh1xEFGI/AAAAAAAAVow/-p8TXkCSKsA/w955-h716-no/IMG_6692.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;The photo.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-fGBi3GZJBhU/VNjoMlEwAoI/AAAAAAAAWFo/ST14Znoo9iU/w537-h716-no/15%2B-%2B3&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;The photographer.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Scribe we hit up &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mummnapa.com/&quot;&gt;Mumm&lt;/a&gt;, known for their sparkling wine, we were excited to get our bubbly on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/zqPzrP1YM95wtjKEFquJdL1Uu9hcYztLdI7ZM5uWVgnQ=w982-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But after the beautiful scenery, our personable host, and the phenomenal wine at Scribe, it was hard to enjoy the cookie cutter feel of Mumm. When we heard the table next to us get the same specials speech, it felt a little dry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-2NLsiiIoOao/VNcBfw_1OhI/AAAAAAAAWBU/ZbpUlpFOJ1o/w537-h716-no/15%2B-%2B17&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least the glasses were beautiful, and fun to drink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-58bncEjsA64/VNjoMigVM2I/AAAAAAAAWFw/Dmfr317lZ-A/w537-h716-no/15%2B-%2B4&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;This is the photo you take after your awkward server cards you.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went with the staff favorites tasting. While I wanted to love the sparkling pinot noir. My favorite was the DVX 2009, (second from the left).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ADODGNNkI10/VNcBf01N0cI/AAAAAAAAWCY/1jt6UWRJFI4/w995-h716-no/15%2B-%2B16&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We left and grabbed the most delicious food (and another 3 cups of coffee) at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.longmeadowranch.com/Farmstead/Restaurant&quot;&gt;Farmstead&lt;/a&gt; in Napa. While I neglected to take pictures, I strongly recommend it. The beets, the salad, and the fish were off the charts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Sunday we headed to Palo Alto to grab Pressed Juicery’s Freeze. Basically, froyo made of their juice flavors. It’s one of those foods I would eat daily if it were in the city, primarily because the vanilla almond milk freeze is 40 calories. Yum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/G4XaunxMch3WwGnfhHqHAa0pAY5Q10zh-vw4qS9cZN79=w771-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;The usual. Vanilla almond milk, with blueberries, coconut and almond butter.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all. A pretty killer weekend. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How was your weekend? Have you been to Napa yet?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Pictures from San Francisco</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-4gxbdVkrdfs/VNLZGY1JKkI/AAAAAAAAVTY/LkbGEHJOmLQ/w794-h500-p-k-no/IMG_6576.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Jury Duty yesterday, J and I were able to play around in the city after my case was released.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-syIKbUei2UE/VNLa4nTiYmI/AAAAAAAAVUU/r1ZcT6Ds2F0/w955-h716-no/IMG_6581.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;This was a fountain before the drought.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite living in the city, I don&amp;#39;t actually work in the city most days. So I rarely catch San Francisco while it&amp;#39;s still light out during the week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-DesR7WfMIrw/VNLYyLeEuHI/AAAAAAAAVTA/6qn9fU8PJPY/w955-h716-no/IMG_6574.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;The less famous bridge in San Francisco.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lately, I&amp;#39;ve felt like I have a lot to do, and so it was nice to have a government imposed day off, but I&amp;#39;m glad my case didn&amp;#39;t end up going to trial. I don&amp;#39;t think I could survive 2-3 weeks of a court case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How&amp;#39;s your week going? If you had a day off of work, where would you go?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Paleo/Primal Inspired WIAW</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-QNCHvBDG8ro/VNG1Ro1stKI/AAAAAAAAVPY/vqaq0hFe4F4/w794-h500-no/15%2B-%2B3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, I challenged myself to explore different diets on &lt;a href=&quot;http://peasandcrayons.com/2015/02/ate-wednesday-211-feed-seymour.html&quot;&gt;WIAW&lt;/a&gt;. One of the main reasons I wanted to take on more diverse eating styles for WIAW, was to shake up my current routine. Trying &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kaybueno.com/1-21-2015/vegan-WIAW.html&quot;&gt;vegan&lt;/a&gt; was great, but it was already an eating style I was relatively comfortable with, and one that my current lifestyle and workplace made easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week I was inspired by the Paleo/Primal/Keto diets out there. Now. I say inspired because I think it’s naive to think I can read about a way of eating, emulate it for a day, and really understand the workings. If you follow &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.marksdailyapple.com/&quot;&gt;Mark’s Daily Apple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://robbwolf.com/&quot;&gt;Robb Wolf&lt;/a&gt;, or even &lt;a href=&quot;http://paleomg.com/&quot;&gt;PaleOMG&lt;/a&gt;, you’re going to get a much more developed view of these diets. For me, I just wanted to shuck routine, and maybe even find a new eating style I was better suited to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to prep a lot for this week, and I didn’t even finish all the prep I wanted to. I took a lot of inspiration from &lt;a href=&quot;https://ieatirunblog.wordpress.com/2014/08/04/recipe-nut-bombs-primal-fruit-parfait/&quot;&gt;IEatIRun&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started with a twist on her nut bombs. (I was out of almonds). Which are pretty similar to most of the energy bites out there. Even post paleo experimenting, I’ve been eating these on a regular basis. Enough to have made them twice now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-UEIErzYhiMc/VMcuid51EXI/AAAAAAAAUyI/6Fkwwwzg7J8/w1041-h702-no/IMG_6432.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;snack prep&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Breakfast was also an IEatIRun rip off. I made a coconut cream parfait, with crumbled nut bombs, a few sliced strawberries and coconut cream from &lt;a href=&quot;http://cookeatpaleo.com/how-to-make-coconut-whipped-cream/&quot;&gt;this recipe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/QzlnUACF12QKFkfgG_a_6lzSps2TQc4E4rOn5VR0tgdB=w868-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;breakfast&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For lunch I was stuck with what was at work. When consulting with a friend who eats Paleo at the same company, he told me his biggest issue was finding food that wasn’t cooked in canola oil. Fortunately, I got lucky with olive oil ahi tuna, a salad, and zucchini dressed in an avocado, citrus, and olive oil dressing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-TmTTKcy45to/VNG1RjQA9RI/AAAAAAAAVP0/s9pe8iac0OI/w962-h716-no/15%2B-%2B4&quot; alt=&quot;lunch&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was swamped with work until dinner, but I had brought nut bombs in case I couldn’t find a reasonable snack. I popped one before and Iyengar yoga class. (A good stretch, but not my beloved Vinyasa.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For dinner, I grabbed a pesto chicken breast, smothered it in a chipotle salsa, and had a side salad and guacamole. I don’t know why I don’t eat this dinner more often...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/jE1J_zJ2v5Hhtx2BmqBuuiS4EE8hXpRbQHhk7fPF1sUi=w964-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;dinner&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, this was definitely a blast, and definitely out of my usual element for food choices. I had to be a little more discerning. I&amp;#39;d love to up my paleo trend to a week, or a month, but I have a few consistent meals that don&amp;#39;t really fit right now. So I&amp;#39;ll have to get to planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you eat paleo? Have you ever tried it?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My New Workouts</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-TxUgcXAzs7k/VNBmdItxp4I/AAAAAAAAVK0/VmNXDnlqNxY/w794-h500-p-k-no/IMG_6536.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the year, I &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kaybueno.com/1-1-2015/resolutions.html&quot;&gt;challenged myself&lt;/a&gt; to quite a few fitness feats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year I achieved a lot in terms of flexibility, and running. I completed my first half marathon, and regular yoga sessions have helped me feel almost bendy and stretchy. But even with improvements there, I’ve been incredibly deficient when it comes to strength. I can barely do a couple of solid push ups, and I’m nowhere near my dream goal. One pull up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’ve been working through some plyometric circuits to improve strength. So far, I’ve been really really ridiculously sore. (But happy!) While I’m not ready for heavy weights yet. (I think this is the road to weight lifting addiction). This has been my current set up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-FJ1Rh5fkjv0/VNBmipn6lkI/AAAAAAAAVLE/CjmF3ss754A/w699-h716-no/IMG_6541.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;The bare necessities.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I end up doing about 30 minutes of circuits. Today focused on legs, and had a bunch of squats, lunges, box step-ups, and jumping. While I still feel like a goon during the workout, I was much smoother, and less tired this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My biggest dilemma right now, is that, in order to fit this in along with my other training, it means I’m working out twice a day, five days a week. Which might not be too bad, except that work has been pretty swamped lately. The reason I have a giant exercise room to myself in these pictures is because I’m working out at 9pm. Well after most people have left the office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-5ywotTF0G1A/VNBmjgHDTtI/AAAAAAAAVLM/BBFgjkXUpm4/w955-h716-no/IMG_6542.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;My least favorite part. The jump rope. 5 year old me is disappointed.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, I do both “activities” at night. After the gym clears out, and once my work is done. If I could, I’d love to do a morning session, and an evening session, but I can’t find any way to swing that with my schedule. (The extra morning shower is what kills it!) So lately, I’ve just been trying to hit both workouts, and if I don’t. Well. I don’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the bright side, I’m really loving the plyometric workouts. While I hate every minute of them while I’m doing them. I kind of missed being this sore. (Is that weird, it’s weird?) And I feel better balanced fitting them in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My other favorite part? They fit anywhere. Which is super convenient because I’m meeting my sister in Vegas in 10 days! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When and where do you workout? What types of exercises are your favorite?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Weekend Update</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-So64JhigMws/VM73hvtTpuI/AAAAAAAAVHc/trHNvYGIu7c/w794-h500-p-k-no/IMG_6518-SMILE.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ain’t no party like a Communist Party, ‘cuz a Communist Party is mandatory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This weekend we celebrated the fact that two of J’s roommates, and also the fall of the Berlin Wall have been around 25 years with a “Communist Party”. (If slightly off color humor, or potentially offensive recreations of history are not your thing, avoid this post.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We crafted a foam Berlin wall to bring down at midnight and celebrated the fall of communism. While this may be the oddest party theme ever, there were a surprising amount of good costumes. A testament to the crazy things you can get at surplus stores on Haight St.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/EMntbgaUErXxhbjhTii_ks-OXC0Ptfs8o-_niZ7-EVFU=w484-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=caption&gt;Many vodka sodas were consumed in the making of this picture.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While, usually, I’m not much for big raging parties, it’s fun once or twice a year to feel my age and do it up. It’s also not every day you find out what your boyfriend would look like as Ronald Reagan. So. There’s that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/rD0idEnJjKLqfxWg7PT-2LC9Zzku290LgwwxiOtzoGvB=w682-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=caption&gt;This is what my nightmares are made of.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunday morning I was supposed to run a 5k, while &lt;a href=&quot;//www.almostgettingittogether.com&quot;&gt;Cassie&lt;/a&gt; did the half. Unfortunately, after a night of bacchanalia, I was not ready for the 6:30 a.m. wake up call that came along with the run. So I made amends by offering to grab brunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/pZC6ifW458ujpOKdbh88FE2VgZaj7l_YhcEpQ-FuzUg-=w1041-h607-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=caption&gt;You just gained 5 pounds looking at this sandwich. :)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hit up a carnival themed cafe, and J convinced me to get this incredibly delicious monstrosity, aka a Chicken and Waffle sandwich. Easily one of the best waffles I’ve had. Which was good since waffles are both wonderful hangover food, and half marathon recovery food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then did the most un-American thing imaginable, and ditched the Super Bowl to run errands with Cassie. It was magical and now I want to buy everything imaginable from West Elm. Thank god I don’t own a car to haul it back to my house in.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What I ate Wednesday, when I was sick.</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/oKRuIdy53j7KgrtuuttwX3gD3-q648hgDXrvtfOJZGsW=w794-h500-no&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had a beautiful WIAW planned that was supposed to feature ingredients and plates that looked something like the picture above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, when I woke up, I felt miserable. I could barely taste anything (such a waste), and my throat was scratchy and sore. And all my beautiful plans of nuts and other healthy fats were lost to ideas of soup and frozen drinks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being sick is hard enough, but trying to make decent food choices when you feel like your throat is made of sandpaper is quite the struggle. Between approximately 285 cups of tea, and a few shots of DayQuil, here’s &lt;a href=&quot;//www.peasandcrayons.com&quot;&gt;WIAW&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started the morning with a mango, orange, banana smoothie, and a bowl of apple cinnamon teff cereal. Having never had teff as a breakfast item, it&amp;#39;s pretty close in taste to cream of wheat, or oatmeal. Its texture is much finer, almost like chia, or maybe even as fine as sand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/UVSoTGXafWQwo_cmMrtKVUPipRdIgTVpqIGx63HfP7Ij=s716-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=caption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During lunch I made a break for the soup bar, after filling a bowl, I grabbed a plate of salad, sushi, and quinoa. Since you can&amp;#39;t get Mom&amp;#39;s chicken and dumpling (or noodle if you&amp;#39;re a purist) when you&amp;#39;re 2000 miles away, miso soup and some greens is about as good as it gets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Odqw1ug7eRk/VMiaEPLgjUI/AAAAAAAAU4U/lcIl3ATrp9I/w1041-h605-no/15%2B-%2B2&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For snacks I headed to the juice bar, and grabbed a ginger and greens juice and some blueberry oatmeal bites. The bites didn’t really taste like much, but that may have been because I’m sick, or because the juice killed my pallette with a ginger bomb. I&amp;#39;m kind of infatuated with my juice bar, the employees are always cheery, and mix the best drinks. I give them my ailment (DOMS, illness, 3pm fog), and they find me a juice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Z2Gj4LM40HY/VMiaEN1gb6I/AAAAAAAAU34/OZKquYFxSTc/s716-no/15%2B-%2B4&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the night I grabbed Ramen with some friends. Hands down the best meal of the day. The spicyness made me forget I ever had sinuses, and the bowl came out so hot that it was basically a noodle sauna.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-xo8Bj1urVR8/VMiaEDTh69I/AAAAAAAAU3s/iIyWZk_Qcjo/w784-h716-no/15%2B-%2B5&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve got to tell you, I&amp;#39;m so over being sick. When I was a kid, I remember having a light cold as being kind of fun. You got to stay home from school, watch TV, read, chill. Now, having a head cold just means I have to focus more to get my everything at work done, and I feel like I&amp;#39;m wearing a perpetual nose plug, which makes eating, exercising, and talking so much fun. Sexy. I know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you get over a cold? What&amp;#39;s the best thing to eat when you&amp;#39;re sick? :(&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Living #NoExcuses, when all I want to do is make excuses.</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-dV5NMnpaJcY/VB9zmbzGgQI/AAAAAAAAKMo/XOZv6fp_7Ws/w794-h500-no/IMG_0732.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lately, I’ve been a part of Sweat Pink’s #NoExcuses challenge, and this week they asked us to “Share why YOU live with #NoExcuses”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when I received that email. I almost laughed. See, I definitely don’t live with #NoExcuses, I live with many excuses, loads of excuses. In fact, I’m probably on my way to being the queen of excuses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when it comes to exercising, I’m that person who throughout the day, is thinking of all the socially appropriate ways to evade my gym plans. But when the clock hits 6pm, I (usually!) still go work out. Because, while I live with a whole bunch of excuses, I make sure I eliminate them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My most popular excuses and how I combat them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;1. I don’t have my [article of workout wear], so I can’t workout today!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has been as pathetic as “I don’t have a hairband, guess I can’t go to the gym!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To beat this excuse I use my filing cabinet, not for documents and files, but for spare gym clothes. Currently I have 5 shirts, 2 pairs of socks, a spare pair of shoes, a million hair ties and a water bottle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Pr1zliR6qR_aFw0KLMn168BA263Bwdp4pvbXUeqZd5Cu=w777-h672-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;I know, my filing cabinet outfits do not match.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;2) I have a lot of work to do, and I’m too tired to workout.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is probably my most convincing excuse, because my job does take priority over fitness. (Otherwise I&amp;#39;d do 8 hour days of vinyasa and soul cycle. But it doesn&amp;#39;t pay the bills yo.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it might be a good excuse if there wasn&amp;#39;t a gym onsite where I can always get a speedy workout in. Even if I&amp;#39;m so brain dead I can&amp;#39;t manage the gym, I can always take a 30 minute walk to think things over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/1qJlC77bHMvcAHS3QyCX8din9KlLWW_1INf-Ss-bMlIH=s446-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;If every workoout looked like this, I swear, I&amp;#39;d never skip.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;3) I can’t find time to work-out, or there&amp;#39;s an event I can’t skip is going on when I usually head to the gym.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I try to remind myself that fitness is a priority, and that many people wake up incredibly early in order to squeeze it in. (Like 5 a.m. early.) I can (and should) do that too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/UE3f8YiJSUV41bOSZQnFiqs2h0vqQr4om3YFcmQE0fgt=w566-h672-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Besting my excuses gets me to the post gym selfie..&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, living #NoExcuses isn&amp;#39;t a matter of never having excuses, it&amp;#39;s working on subtracting them until you get to #NoExcuses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Excuses are part of my day to day, but moving past the excuses is what makes me proud, it&amp;#39;s what makes me a competitor, and it&amp;#39;s what makes me live &amp;quot;#NoExcuses&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are your excuses? And how do you get past them?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A weekend of eats!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/zNw6rlgBITxSALproBWq7wzIbGk3iKjaqFhtrFdvvvGi=w794-h500-no&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks so much for all your sympathy over the crash! J has mostly received tough love from his manly roommates, and so it was nice to read all your lovely comments to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This weekend was the least vain weekend of all time, I managed to take almost no photos of myself. Partially because I was home, helping take care of J, and not out adventuring, and partially because I spent most of my weekend eating really delicious food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saturday night I went out with &lt;a href=&quot;//www.almostgettingittogether.com&quot;&gt;Cassie&lt;/a&gt;, to Cha-ya. It’s a vegetarian/vegan Japanese restaurant that is so hole-in-the-wall, it doesn’t even have a website. Which may be the norm for non-chain restaurants in a lot of cities, but even the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.letsbefrankdogs.com/&quot;&gt;grass fed hotdog stand&lt;/a&gt; in my neighborhood has it’s own site. So not being on the internet here is kind of a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-xtckJoAjNhc/VMXtbycCoKI/AAAAAAAAUcY/pUCfBCa8eTo/s716-no/IMG_6355.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;My suggestion? Order avocado everything.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunday night I met up with a friend to try out a Rhythm and Motion dance class. It was quite an adventure, primarily because I barely have rhythm, and mostly have motion. My biggest takeaway? I totally underestimated dancers, I was dripping in sweat by end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know I probably shouldn’t take on more things, but I really loved the class and might continue to go on Sunday nights. Can you pick up dance if you’re only doing it one night a week?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After class we met up with another friend and cooked dinner. Or really, to be fair, they cooked me dinner. It was phenomenal, and I apologize that my pictures don&amp;#39;t do it any justice. I was too focused on enjoying the company and the candlelight to take good photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/CVE_vrsa_m7WGU8LJMyxwpKCCMqdbzhGaWKI8i5ca4xK=w958-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Frisee salad with bacon, poached egg, and a bacon mustard vinaigrette.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We planned the dinner around my friend who is doing keto (with some serious success!) I was mostly impressed with how delicious keto is. Yum. Bacon. Egg. Cheese. Yum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-6-ji7SCwjuA/VMXvNKLtZjI/AAAAAAAAUgg/zFMsWyMB96c/w955-h716-no/15%2B-%2B1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Roasted chicken with a roasted cauliflower and broccolini done “mac &amp;amp; cheese” style.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of the first times I’ve been convinced you can cook better at home than in a restaurant. Everything was amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cutest picture of my weekend? A sleepy great dane I ran into on a walk I did. He, or maybe she, was chilling in the front of a designer eyewear shop. Makes me miss my mom’s dog. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-5MEWODkUSvg/VMXtQl9ogoI/AAAAAAAAUas/dS4syAxWnpQ/w955-h716-no/IMG_6340.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;San Francisco&amp;#39;s dog population isn&amp;#39;t helping my puppy fever.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How was your weekend? What should I do about the dance class? How often do you work out in a week?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Crash</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-ntbpd03xf70/VL1oRr6iBqI/AAAAAAAAUAw/3utAHGXUW_8/w794-h500-p-k-no/IMG_6216.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kaybueno.com/1-19-2015/MLK-day.html&quot;&gt;I posted a sad photo of J from the emergency room&lt;/a&gt;. This week, I’ve been in and out of urgent care, an emergency room, I’ve learned to splint toes, clean wounds, and how to nearly mummify someone in non-stick gauze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But all of that pales in comparison to how the accident went down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, J and I had plans to spend the weekend biking in Napa. Winter is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.napavintners.com/harvest/life_cycle_of_a_grape.asp&quot;&gt;pruning season&lt;/a&gt; in Napa Valley, and so it means less tourists, cheaper hotels, and more open roads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/JB4XVjDdXT7fWHAjDUd-tzYVws0QZWHdl7EA1quNka4R=w955-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;This is your boyfriend in Napa before he’s wrecked&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve done this route, or similar routes before. We planned for a 2 mile bike ride to the winery, and then about 25 more miles traversing the mountains nearby before we’d head back. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-f4UAxBTYovU/VL1oEb5NRqI/AAAAAAAAT_E/pcJd9aFMZKA/w794-h500-no/IMG_6207.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though it took us awhile, we reached the top of the summit, and prepared for the fun part. Coasting downhill. J has always been more fearless than I am, so the rule is that he can go as fast as he wants, as long as he waits for me to catch up every so often. Yes, I am a baby who sometimes rides her brakes downhill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Arg1sJDd-lI/VL1oS9w2ahI/AAAAAAAAUA8/Oy0VHiTGLDM/w955-h716-no/IMG_6217.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;J biking&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;We took some show-offy bike photos just minutes before eating it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started downhill, and after a few turns, I saw Jon waiting for me on the side of the road. I assumed he was just waiting for me to catch up, but as I got closer I noticed his bike handlebars were tangled around the frame, his face was pained, and his shirt had been completely shredded up and down the sides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turned out, he was taking the downhill at 40 mph, and didn&amp;#39;t realize the next turn was so sharp. He started losing control, and grabbed the wrong brake, the rear brake, which made his bike fishtail. He thought he had control, but then he hit the gravel and went rolling. He told me, coincidentally, that right before he fell, he thought &amp;quot;Wow, this is the most beautiful ride I&amp;#39;ve ever done.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About a minute after the crash, a huge white SUV pulled up and asked if we were okay. He stopped for us and opened the trunk. It was full of boxes, first aid equipment, hazard clean up bags, knives, etc. I knew at this point we were either in really good hands. Or about to be murdered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out we were saved. The good Samaritan was a local Sheriff from the CSI division. He helped us clean up J, load our bikes into the car, and brought us to the ER. He had to duck out because he needed to get to a crime scene, but this guy pretty much saved us. If he hadn&amp;#39;t stopped, I would have had to bike the remaining 12 miles to civilization and call an ambulance from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/rv4t9-sPGowcrBgexwJPczCxcFBTsqx95cOoxtRq4dnT=w955-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;J ER&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;J got to the hospital, where he had many X-rays. Found out he broke his toe, and sprained his rib and shoulder. Received some serious pain killers, and was cleaned up even more. We made it out alive, and even got to eat BBQ after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a cool story, and despite our accident, I definitely love, and want to continue biking in Napa. But for future hikes, bikes or just work outs, I think it&amp;#39;s incredibly important to have an emergency plan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are about 100 ways this could have gone worse. If I was ahead of J. If no one stopped. If J hurt himself worse and needed immediate care. We didn&amp;#39;t even have band-aids on us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the future, we&amp;#39;ll definitely be carrying basic first aid supplies, I&amp;#39;m making both of us take our phones, and we&amp;#39;ll have to have a plan of action for getting lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s the craziest thing that&amp;#39;s happened to you lately? Do you have plans in case of emergencies?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What I ate Wednesday, Vegan Exploration!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Xh2D9LWYwIs/VL7tpK7-yRI/AAAAAAAAUUM/c-YPG3NLN0s/w794-h500-p-k-no/15%2B-%2B2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kaybueno.com/1-14-2015/WIAW.html&quot;&gt;Last week&lt;/a&gt;, I felt like my WIAW were becoming predictable. I think if I took another picture of oatmeal, or bagged eggs, my iPhone camera was going to revolt. In order to keep my sanity, and make sure my camera roll wasn’t full up of the same pictures shot every Tuesday. I decided to try different eating styles for &lt;a href=&quot;//www.peasandcrayons.com&quot;&gt;WIAW&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Wednesday I decided to explore what it’s like to be a Vegan. Obviously, doing something for one day doesn’t produce a lot of mindblowing outcomes, and there’s no before/after. I figured it would get me out of a food rut and make me try something new. My goal was to not show you my usual week made vegan, but to try to go “all in” and pick the food I felt best fit the diet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I ran in late after helping bandage up J’s wounds, so I didn’t have time to grab breakfast from a cafe. It was a little hard to avoid the call of eggs and yogurt, my usual morning staples. But I found a perfectly ripe banana and some Justin’s and combined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I only have the before picture, but I cut the banana in half and spread the peanut butter inside. Enough of my co-workers walked by and joked that I didn’t have a future in surgery, so you just get this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-YHWB5kyPtD0/VL7tpPMqSxI/AAAAAAAAUTs/J9xnVuuzGYs/w600-h500-no/15%2B-%2B1&quot; alt=&quot;banana and peanut butter&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my concerns about taking a vegan day at work was that I’d spend the day eating side dishes, and never feel full. Fortunately, I found a cafe that had quite a few solid vegan entrees. I’m terrible at deciding, so I picked two dishes, figuring I could just eat half of each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ate all of both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first was an Eggplant Caponata, Pine Nuts, and Whole Wheat Pita with Celery Salad and Mustard Seed Vinaigrette&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-2Pxn4GmtYhU/VL7JC9SWZgI/AAAAAAAAUOo/tghkRrr0y8I/w955-h716-no/IMG_6290.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Eggplant Caponata&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My other lunch portion was Kyuri Zuke, Avocado, and Shiso Flake Maki, with Yuzu &amp;amp; Pepper Edamame. Basically, a fancy way of saying pickled cucumber and avocado sushi rolls. Before today I’d probably have told you it’s not sushi without raw fish, old me was wrong, these were delicious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/--avHlV6xRKo/VL7yQU69NfI/AAAAAAAAUVI/ksJR4fGuG_M/w600-h500-no/15%2B-%2B1&quot; alt=&quot;sushi&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I purchased a three month subscription from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.urthbox.com/&quot;&gt;UrthBox&lt;/a&gt; of healthy snacks. (Side note: I think UrthBox is good but expensive, they’ve had deals on Gilt City a lot lately) Quite a few were vegan. So I grabbed these fruit chews. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, I thought, “These aren’t much different than Starbursts!”. Then I found out, Starbursts aren’t vegan. Though some varieties appear not to have gelatin, it seems many incorporate Shellac in their confectioner’s glaze, which is derived from insects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So given that, these were pretty fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;J wanted to get out of the house for a little bit, so we went out and grabbed a quick dinner at a local indian fusion restaurant. They were super sweet and had tons of vegan options and substitutions. I ended up with a combo platter. Dark lighting but amazing meal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/sWpSt-G6-5mTKl8sD_QWI1Mu-J9ZC7T8l1b39BdXYqkk=w600-h500-no&quot; alt=&quot;dinner&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did I feel?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I definitely wasn’t hungry. Granted, I basically almost ate two lunches, but I didn’t find myself missing meat&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Could I go Vegan?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I had a vegan friend group, or a vegan significant other, definitely. But I am unfortunately a person who caves to social pressure and I really, really love eating non-vegan deep dish pizza with J.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What will I keep from Veganism?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That breakfast was amazing and I can’t believe it took me this long to make. Also, I’d be more willing to grab a vegan entree at work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you vegan? Could you do vegan? What good vegan eats did I miss out on?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ll be back tomorrow with a recap of the good parts of the weekend. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope your weekend is, or was better than ours. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Things I’m loving Friday. Basically wine.</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ypMSawCEbHHza4bUyWGJ4Nbaf-AqUC6OyvhlMEctTqtb=w794-h500-p-k-no&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fridays are always sweeter when you have a 3 day weekend after them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a little extra time, J and I wanted to get out of the city for at least one night, so we&amp;#39;re driving to Napa to get in a long bike ride and some wine tastings. Even Napa’s highways have bike lanes, so it’s one of my favorite places to cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/mwTcYvm7wjyj05_r2VTcfiOMwnnCfTiFDYGHXuUYJfIu=w955-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;wine&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Great outdoor patio, but we went because the winery looked casual enough for bikes.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Year, New You, and all that. But New Year, New Vacations is where I’m at this week. I’ve been trying to make light plans to see family, friends, and get in some more great hikes. I might try to convince J to go to Utah again. But we’re leaning toward southeast Asia this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ypMSawCEbHHza4bUyWGJ4Nbaf-AqUC6OyvhlMEctTqtb=w955-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;making plans&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Zion is the best National Park. Sorry.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My sister gifted me a grinder and some fancy coffee, so lately I’ve been trying to class it up and use a french press. If nothing else, it makes me feel way better about my morning. Also, I’m slowly collecting all the mugs I can. It’s probably my worst impulse purchase. At this moment, my apartment has more mugs than plates. Oops!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/q4b4zynlcno6AE-BDNg-6L-1Pem_IjFuW_hZ4BrL-KYs=w704-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;good coffee&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really need to make an appointment to get my lashes done again. When I saw this picture in my feed, it reminded me of why I do it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not affiliated with them or anything, but as the laziest person ever. I book literally every beauty appointment on &lt;a href=&quot;//www.styleseat.com&quot;&gt;Style Seat&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#39;s nice to keep my hair, eyelashes, and manicure appointments all in one place. And since I’m the worst at calling places, this is arguably my favorite start-up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/jCI-vPiOtyoxn7DRHK-3yC-zcrdeC6I1a29DOztUC3S8=s716-no&quot; alt=&quot;eyelashes&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Best appointment ever, I sleep for two hours and wake up to lashes like this.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finally booked a hotel for SeaWheeze. I’m staying at the Pan Pacific with the madre. Last year, I left this until the last minute and I was a wreck. Everything was like 600 dollars a night if you wanted to be anywhere within walking distance to the race. I finally discovered a &lt;a href=&quot;http://ocanadahouse.com/&quot;&gt;bed and breakfast&lt;/a&gt;, which I’d strongly recommend, mom and I loved it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this year, I got an earlier start, and a great deal on &lt;a href=&quot;//www.hotwire.com&quot;&gt;Hotwire&lt;/a&gt;, which puts us much closer to the starting line, and more importantly the showcase store. :) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-1luNQ70MoaM/VGrZutEVkmI/AAAAAAAAO5Q/iWZhd64aB2M/w955-h716-no/seawheeze.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;seawheeze&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;I&amp;#39;m mentally preparing for this madness again. :) &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are you looking forward to this weekend? Have you ever used Hotwire before? Honestly, it scared me a little not knowing what hotel you&amp;#39;ll get when you book, but it was also kind of thrilling to find out.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How I’m eating in January: Dessert isn&#39;t Mandatory</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/YwHpMLh6wcWef9Mh2pqBPhrMosInm-U2j8zcSu7CDYbc=w794-h500-p-k-no&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You know the book “Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus”? The entire premise is that there are undeniable differences between men and women. And while I’m no relationship counselor, I actually think J and I are pretty similar, similar values, similar thought processes, similar jobs. But the one thing we don’t have in common is that J doesn’t really like sugary sweets. And I crave them all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I have one sugary treat, I slowly convince myself I should have another, and maybe another, and just one more. Honestly, I envy those who assert moderation with froyo, cookies, pancakes, etc. It isn’t something I think I’ll ever be able to do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-FjdAIQNBw2Y/VLdRgvbZv-I/AAAAAAAATkw/Djxd6uO9Giw/w537-h716-no/15%2B-%2B1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;This wasn’t the only cookie.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I get into this mindset that whenever I do something difficult, or stressful, or even mildly praiseworthy, I deserve a treat. Or that because my coworkers are having dessert after a meal, I too should be able to have a cupcake, cookie or froyo after every lunch like they do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal for January, and the subsequent months, is to only have dessert when it’s something monumental. For example. Fro-yo at work? Not really a treat. It’s available every day, if I don’t have some today, I can come back and have some tomorrow. But macarons from Paris, a cake baked by a good friend for a wedding, or even a few bites of chocolate with wine while in Napa. Totally worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/UYdzEpHjAl04ZJxIj7uBd79wukl8eHNIOdMK2h5DOxDA=w1041-h656-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;I can’t decide whether I’m more sad, or impressed that I was able to make a froyo collage&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of temptation, the same place I brew tea, grab water, or snag an orange also has fishbowls full of M&amp;amp;Ms, Reeses, and more. And every meal at work has dessert alongside it. But having an easy rule, makes it easier to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/YwHpMLh6wcWef9Mh2pqBPhrMosInm-U2j8zcSu7CDYbc=w1041-h680-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;There&amp;#39;s even one of these filled with Justin&amp;#39;s Nut Butters. How can I resist?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because dessert isn’t something I’m owed. By eating my lunch, I didn’t do anything candy, cookie, cake-worthy. And, regardless, food shouldn’t be the primary way I reward myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know some people love moderation, and I’m a big fan of you doing whatever works for you. One day, I hope to get to a place where I can practice moderation without finishing an entire pan of brownies in one sitting. :) But until then, I need to be a little stricter with myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you have food “rules”? Is there anything you won’t eat?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>WIAW - Craving&#39;s ahoy</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;http://peasandcrayons.com/2015/01/ate-wednesday-208.html&quot;&gt;Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; was brought to you by my cravings. It was a day I ate the things I was hungry for. Which worked out pretty well overall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next few WIAW, I think I might experiment spending a day eating other popular diets. While I like the way I eat now, I think it might be fun to shake things up in the New Year. My work offers a lot of flexibility when it comes to vegan, paleo, raw, gluten free, etc diets, and while I have the chance I should try it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day started with a pretty standard cup of steel cut oats, I added, raisins, coconut, peanut butter, and a little bit of ground flax and cinnamon. Delicious, once I stirred it all together. But needed more protein. I was ravenous by lunch!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-aTCM_ILWK-Q/VLVKMHgp9hI/AAAAAAAATdk/waIBUaoWuS4/w955-h716-no/IMG_6045.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;breakfast&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lunch was slightly large. I had both a grilled chicken sandwich, and vegan broccoli-kale soup. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-lmH2PkbQ4qs/VLX0ajAjIJI/AAAAAAAATdM/rzSylSquBes/w973-h716-no/IMG_6053.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;lunch&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was looking forward to the chicken when I ordered it, but I have to say, this soup was the star. Packed with vegetables, and a smooth consistency, you can bet I’m ordering this guy again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-1t3kEu1EU2U/VLX0eSO86kI/AAAAAAAATdU/VXcJ3uOR4Wo/w948-h716-no/IMG_6055.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;lunch soup&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So many snacks today! I’ve been eating my weight in satsuma mandarins lately. They are delicious. I had one with a little bag of pistachios. (Small win, this is the first bag of pistachios where I’ve been able to unshell every single one!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-j3Uf0qpReQs/VLVYFbmw8PI/AAAAAAAATd4/uFwz4jqyQFU/w955-h716-no/IMG_6049.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;snack nuts and orange&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And a little square of cheese. I love cheese, and have split entire cheese plates with others before. I’m always a little sad when I realize this is the serving size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-xWdbSCPOF9o/VLX0gc8k4II/AAAAAAAATeA/loYxSCAkuAA/w715-h716-no/IMG_6056.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;snack cheese&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Old habits die hard. Also I had a really long yoga class that stretched past dinner. So when I biked home at 8 pm, I didn’t really want to do more than put a pot of popcorn on the stove.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/AGD2fVv4LCD-IpOliBHLiZ5IRirjuFlzDY-fkOidK5-o=w955-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;Dinner popcorn&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also unpictured, a cookies and cream quest bar. But! I kind of hated this. Did I eat this wrong? It was kind of slimy and the only redeeming quality was the cookie portion of this guy. I’ve heard people microwave and broil these, does that make it better?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s the best thing you ate all day? the worst? How do you eat a quest bar (if you eat them)?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Aspen Glow, Weekend Recap</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s one of those Mondays, where I can’t believe it’s Monday already. I think it has a little something to do with the fact that I spent my entire weekend here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-0gC_Qyb39hc/VLN6g-9adpI/AAAAAAAATXc/co52EKkcLns/w864-h531-no/IMG_6019.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time flies a lot faster on a mountain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;J and I spent the weekend in Tahoe with fifteen of our friends. We rented a cabin, bought an unwieldy amount of food from Costco, and skied our hearts out. J, my ever patient boyfriend and ex-ski-instructor, spent most of his time trying to teach me how to come down a mountain without dying. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mostly succeeded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Oh_vdfMVi6c/VLHAK2kIqxI/AAAAAAAATXs/pAiXHmIMNS4/w864-h648-no/IMG_6012.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was my second time skiing. Even though I didn’t make it to the blue runs, (in fact, I kind of freaked out about the one I did), I had a blast. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I think taking lessons from someone close to you can be a disaster, I learned really well from J, and didn’t kill him (neither death by ski crash, nor death from over critiquing my form). Which is pretty much a relationship win in my book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with 15 people, the cabin went smoothly, we didn’t trash the place, get too drunk, and we didn’t cook all our breakfast bacon at 3 am. Which the group took as a positive sign we’re getting older. We all returned home safely, and to the most beautiful sunset I’ve seen ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Pj2BErvuo8c/VLN68DeKXAI/AAAAAAAATXU/4pXfZZjVViE/w863-h358-no/IMG_6039.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I’m pretty much sore everywhere, and I feel really energized. Which is a pretty great excuse to spend a weekend doing something new. I’ll definitely be skiing again soon. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How was your weekend?   &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Preweekend Happenings</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This whole week I’ve felt under the weather. I’m pretty sure this is what happens when you start feeding your body actual nutrients after a two week diet of sugar and alcohol. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been taking it easy, a lot of my coworkers have been out sick, and I&amp;#39;d hate to make it worse. But my body really did me in this time, because while I was chilling at home in a shark onesie, trying to figure out what my stomach would consider eating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-popriW-o1rA/VH6hu6tBwzI/AAAAAAAATGw/KcQDZigrIpQ/w537-h716-no/IMG_5015.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My boyfriend was meeting Chris Hemsworth (who he keeps adorably referring to as Liam.) I got this Snapchat as I was laying on the couch, wishing I could surgically remove my intestines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/NqGzdOomSihcELoqn6MQiptlK2A76QbaXMU5n4aA2V1U=w403-h715-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m feeling better today, but that’s not the point! I could have been there if it wasn&amp;#39;t for my scumbag stomach. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw this candle on someone’s blog this week (sorry I forgot who, my memory is terrible). And because I’m an impulsive child, I bought it Thursday night. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big surprise. It smells like cotton candy, or just straight up sugar, or some saccharine sweet smell you know immediately. And while it’s not the candle I’ll use to seduce my boyfriend into a romantic night (unless your boyfriend loves candy, then this IS your candle), it’s a fun scent to have burning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/WsK-aKJupQyVZ-mLUWnAQTNBMrcdR3EtpWQYopftPZAt=w781-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while I’m not usually a food candle person, I’m glad I grabbed this baby at Target. For 10 dollars we can make my house smell like all the best parts of a carnival. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I took this picture covertly at work of our fruit situation. Is it just me, or does fruit seem more legit when it still has the leaves on it? I keep picking the mandarins that look like they’re still growing on a tree somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/u_tS1bNtXP4S3y8B1bQmBr5NSX4SoAu3B-QIxoG_xcD6=w1041-h713-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hoard like 3 of those puppies a day. Don’t judge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyhow! I&amp;#39;m off skiing this weekend. This is the second time in my life ever, and J&amp;#39;s like 3409803945 time. He was an instructor for a brief period of time, so I try to use him for lessons to save money. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are you up to this weekend?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Allowing myself to suck</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years ago. I didn’t have any hobbies. None. Not because I was busy, or because I had just moved, but because I couldn’t stomach the fact that I might look dumb doing something. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was incredibly insecure. I thought that I needed to look effortless, and attractive, and cool, all the time. And that meant not taking on anything new, because I wasn&amp;#39;t sure I could do it perfectly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/8IbkLAUgzB56G4c9PAqYeZOxeBnXrUFXAdN-UzBjFVIN=w794-h706-no&quot; alt=&quot;dranks with the roomies&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(This is probably what I thought cool looked like.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the event I did end up out of my comfort zone, I wasn’t good at it, I’d just quit. I know, real winning attitude there. It was terrible for me, and probably worse for the people I was around. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I might not have ever really tried anything if I didn’t accidentally stumble upon a hobby I loved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Z8yQO85-AX8/VK4VSw64e0I/AAAAAAAATA0/EwLzC8jKEi8/w960-h637-no/trapeze1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;trapeze&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flying trapeze. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finally wanted to be good at something so badly, I was willing to be bad at it to do so. Flying trapeze was the greatest high (literally) I had ever had, and I was addicted. I was also terrible. I&amp;#39;m inflexible, and tall, and altogether difficult person to catch. But it was amazing. And being bad at trapeze was the best thing that happened to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I figured, once I was a total novice at one thing. Why not make a fool of myself doing all the things I wished I could do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I started running. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/q250TjR-a9ZNhekEpN1N6TxDN3MUUNFaQ__vIcC4hwqA=w955-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;running&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yoga.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/KIMoLaHs688VGrCvkLkCL9w6CLFj_7Sayvbhyb3OWGV7=w932-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today. Am I the best at any of these things? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not even close. I run 9-10 minute miles, I&amp;#39;m just now able to touch the floor in a forward fold, and I&amp;#39;m still the slowest trapeze student to pick up new tricks. I read the most amazing blogs of friends who are spin instructors, serious yogis, competitive runners, and I think &amp;quot;Oh god, what am I doing here?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even as an inflexible, kind of slow student, I&amp;#39;m the happiest me I&amp;#39;ve ever been. I&amp;#39;ve stopped comparing myself to others. I&amp;#39;m much better at celebrating achievements, and I let myself try anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the New Year rolling around, and goals being on everyone&amp;#39;s mind, I want to remind you that you are more than the things you&amp;#39;re good at, and it&amp;#39;s worth trying anything you want to do even if you fail fantastically at it. I would have never run a half, or swung tricks out of lines if I didn&amp;#39;t allow myself to be bad at things first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the immortal words of the cartoon show Adventure Time:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Dude, suckin’ at something is the first step to being sorta good at something”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you suck at?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>WIAW - Resolution Style</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guys. I don’t want to jinx it. But, the new year has me motivated. Real motivated. Like, spend-two-hours-power-cleaning-your-apartment-when-you-get-home-from-work motivated. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it’s been spilling over evvvverywhere. One of the things I knew I needed to rock in January was my eating habits, especially important after I consumed no less than 23495 Christmas cookies while home last week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’m trying to rock way more vegetables, way less sugar, and just a generally healthier eating schedule. So welcome to my favorite day of the week, &lt;a href=&quot;http://peasandcrayons.com/2015/01/ate-wednesday-207.html&quot;&gt;WIAW&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Breakfast is standard. Greek yogurt, so much coffee, and asian pears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-34vH2atyNig/VKwwq9zXEEI/AAAAAAAAS6U/V1WQzZxeQgg/w915-h912-no/IMG_5924.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Breakfast&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to “put your lunch over a salad” salad. One of my good friends in Chicago used to be a chef in a fancy Vegas restaurant, and when I told him about this food strategy, he threatened to disown me. Apparently, greens don’t automatically pair well with “everything”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this is shredded pork, guacamole, jalapenos, pico de gallo, over a salad. I couldn’t decide between the salsa roja, or the yogurt based salsa demente, so I used both. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ChUEd77bnX0/VKxjoXi4s7I/AAAAAAAAS9o/zDJxTCxy-VM/w915-h708-no/IMG_5928.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Lunch&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Snack was an old favorite. Popcorn, which I grabbed a handful or two and put into a vintage Santa mug. I’d like to say it’s because I still have a lot of Christmas spirit, but really it’s because I’m too lazy to put away my decorations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-b6qoUn8hyRM/VKxkINWrasI/AAAAAAAAS9w/WRMWTLOuAac/w915-h985-no/IMG_5937.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Popcorn&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the post where you find out my hands are literally like paddles, or giant oven mitts. But I grabbed a handful of nuts. Best part? NO PEANUTS. I hate nut mixes that are dominated by peanuts. Put them in a nut butter, great. Put them in a trail mix and I’m over it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-fQwpnx64LRk/VKx3W5v5wgI/AAAAAAAAS-s/5FVfJcmwtLc/w915-h1029-no/IMG_5939.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Nuts&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a grand total of three of these parmesan crisps (15 is a serving). But they were so delicious and satiating that I needed to include them. So enjoy the speckled brown that is my dirt floor, and do yourself a favor (if you like dairy) and get on these, or make them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/J30cWAq9evBae1McsNtRkW3QJhxAGwzlcf1SHJ7kA78l=w915-h1046-no&quot; alt=&quot;Parm Crisps&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually, I’m not much for dinner. But I’m trying to rectify that, and realize that popcorn is not a vegetable. So here’s salad part two. I try to relish in the fact that by eating this salad I’m now ahead of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/wk/mm5935.pdf&quot;&gt;75% of Americans in vegetable eating&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ZFOJvOFFc5Nhj83TxRByp9k-nWfMsJHfEJ-Gd7Eusf-d=w728-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;Dinner Salad&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last, unrelated little tidbit. Today is the best Wednesday regardless of what I ate because it’s my mom’s birthday! Even though I hopefully already texted and called her, I want to wish her a third, or fourth Happy Birthday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She’s not only had to put up with me for over 20 years, but she’s down for anything, we’ve done flying trapeze, surfed, and this year we’re running Seawheeze together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-wk05N2A9x-w/VKzTfe5LccI/AAAAAAAATAQ/3BURMU1W6KM/w960-h640-no/momsurf.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mom surfing&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Happy Birthday Madre!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How’s your Wednesday going? &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Snapshots from my Holidays</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chicago was a whirlwind of food, fun, family and friends, but mostly food. I spent 14 days catching up, baking, and reminding myself exactly how much I hate winter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had an amazing time, whether it was schooling my brother’s girlfriend at Mario Party, shopping with my mom at Lululemon, or hanging out with every single person I loved in college. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-cZ0UT1QCpuc/VKVndNKlfvI/AAAAAAAASio/tG9vyyBIBO0/w896-h672-no/IMG_5827.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;city bean&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was cold, and my family had anywhere from 6-8 people crashing in a 3 bedroom home. Which meant we all had a little bit of cabin fever, and were a little bit too friendly. One day, after we were sick of our laptops, I let C cornrow my hair. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the cornrows turned out nice, and eventually ended up in cute curls. It was a painful, crazy idea. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/hma3Msu2xOkkAYXyNwt00ZwjoRcrfINNA8cX3FM_E6Lo=w753-h672-no&quot; alt=&quot;hair braiding&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;J visited for a few days, prior to vacationing with his roommate in Mexico. (And only packed one bag for both trips. Crazy!). We dragged him to our favorite, locally made, ice cream spot. He was excited but very very cold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/xDFQZ4uyuLzQo0aPoq0eymWeYYfsNeHlm4q4561yOw5X=w670-h672-no&quot; alt=&quot;J eating ice cream&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my Christmas gifts was a croissant baking class at Sur la Table. It was basically magical because you didn’t have to do any cleaning, and I got to eat a lot of warm croissants. I&amp;#39;m not sure I&amp;#39;ll ever make a croissant like the ones in Paris, or even the ones at Tartine in San Francisco. But I definitely upped my bread game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I make a lot of faces while baking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/osrWLz6d8uAz6YCYd9l5KhtmwzcKsX2IKO1UZyxFd7ow=w662-h672-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Christmas, my family does fondue. Cheese, meat, and chocolate. It’s delicious. But my sister always ends up outeating everyone when it comes to the beef. So much this year, that I called her Edward Steakerhands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-MEnkX1baILraYEsgCDaXL39aTOsuKlX3l5opvKF7Pgz=s672-no&quot; alt=&quot;fondue&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Posting this makes me miss Chicago already. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How were your holidays? Are you getting back into schedule?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Marking the New Year with New Goals</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Happy New Year! I’ve been busy spending time with family and friends, but wanted to get back to blogging for the kickoff of 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even J made it out here to spend time in Chicago. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-c9ngGjnnnw8/VKVnKn01UVI/AAAAAAAAShI/eaFTzZ8myE0/w955-h716-no/IMG_5819.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of people aren’t fans of resolutions. Gyms fill up for a few weeks. No one wants to go out to eat. Everyone’s telling you what they’ll do differently this year from last year from the year before that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I love resolutions. I adore planning, and after working on a team that does quarterly planning, and weekly check ins. I don’t think you can accurately capture all the things you want to do without written goals.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fitness:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10 pushups.&lt;/strong&gt; This is so pathetic. But. I remember easily pumping out push ups in school, and now I can barely handle one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 pull up.&lt;/strong&gt; Such a stretch goal. I will literally throw a party, a physical party, if I can do a pull up unassisted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-m2mOoRn1tSI/VGrZn8m2nlI/AAAAAAAAO3c/cS96NlCK_jQ/w477-h716-no/bazu-3697090.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The splits.&lt;/strong&gt; I offered all the members of my family 100 dollars if they could do one at any point by the end of 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are notoriously no running goals in here, because I have a few events planned, and I’m not really stressing right now about my speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Blog:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blog more regularly.&lt;/strong&gt; Perhaps with a schedule. Right now I’m kinda just doing whatever I want. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Zr8h4rbF_K8/VGBHjDUlpQI/AAAAAAAAN1w/pv4jcBm7KZY/w955-h716-no/IMG_4454.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hit up more bloggers in real life.&lt;/strong&gt; I love the bloggers I’ve met, and I’d only like to meet more. I tend to travel a good bit during the year, and having gone to a small college, I never have people to meet up in popular cities. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Life:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get ready for bed every night at 11 pm.&lt;/strong&gt; This doesn’t mean go to bed at 11, this means, get ready for bed at 11.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook once a month.&lt;/strong&gt; (I know, hella pathetic) But! Work basically dictates that I never have to cook. But I’m worried if I ever leave the comfort of a large tech company, I’ll be living off Chipotle and toast (not entirely a bad thing)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/JihbdlXE54GXGLFkj-wzlKfFc0qGgLldxsXEFWgZSwrA=w597-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Put down the screens ~30 minutes before bed.&lt;/strong&gt; I’m so attached to my computer, phone, tablet, etc, that I need to spend 30 minutes knitting, reading a book, or just cuddling up before sleeping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Friends:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-MnM_PJe9Q5M/U9p-RxnW4EI/AAAAAAAABHs/_uCH0cN8HnI/w480-h640-no/IMG_0204.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Write letters!&lt;/strong&gt; I just got some really adorable wax and wax stamps as a gift from my mother for Christmas. I’d like to keep in touch with more people, and write and send physical letters. That said, if you ever want some real mail. Email me so I can send some! (I know. Ironic) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep in touch better with friends from home.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take a girls’ trip.&lt;/strong&gt; I have spent a lot of time traveling and vacationing with J. And while I want to keep doing that, I want to do at least one girls’ vacay this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-zoB25pts1Ik/VEMCBYO1OKI/AAAAAAAAMCY/bel2wDqnmB8/w955-h716-no/IMG_3922.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d go with anyone if we ended up here. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than making goals, I believe checking in on goals is important. So I’ve put 3 month check-ins on my calendar (March 29, June 28, Sept 27, and Dec 31), to let you and myself know how I’m progressing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you feel about resolutions? What are your goals for this year? &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>WIAW - Christmas Eve Style</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good morning! (Or really, whenever you happen to be reading this). Usually, on Wednesdays, I break down all the delicious things I eat for &lt;a href=&quot;http://peasandcrayons.com/2014/12/merry-christmahanukwanzaakah-wiaw-205-2.html&quot;&gt;WIAW&lt;/a&gt;. And today isn’t any different, except that, this morning, we had our big family Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this late blog, is brought to you by sugar-cookie, animal-shaped waffles. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-dGBlwomLlIc/VJsKKdOmRLI/AAAAAAAASJk/zjshDFpz-Mk/w896-h672-no/wafflecollage.png&quot; alt=&quot;Waffles&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been home, in Chicago for the week, so aside from the time change, the weather change, and the change in scenery, my eating schedule also feels wonky. Lunch and dinner feel too early, all the food tastes different, etc. By Wednesday, I was kind of craving my normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the great things about having homogenous work offices is it’s easy to get similar food everywhere. So after the serious cookie overload, I was ready to get something a little healthier in me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started with fruit and a biscotti. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/TqRyscLqsRDqSU7ALcZdxwF6gmaetqfPRyOlLRufr8_h=w973-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;Breakfast&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lunch was a salad with pico de gallo, corn, olives, and root vegetable puree, carrot ginger soup, and a cut of arctic char (Which I found out, after watching Alton Brown on the plane for 5 hours, is a close relative of both salmon, and trout, aka delicious).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-SLtaXMmflME/VJhprozEsDI/AAAAAAAARzM/GIkJ_mHWNio/w1041-h599-no/IMG_5578.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Lunch&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mid-day, the chef team put out vats of hot chocolate. Who was I to say no? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Q-AtKJkaJ5zaBuMOsJ_Lvxp643pjACsSExKy3DUVPpIn=w616-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;Hot chocolate snack&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I actually didn’t end up finishing it all, and when I washed out my cup, found a layer of sprinkles caked onto the bottom. Can we say, addiction?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-g6-NmHLdqHs/VJsIl4H3XbI/AAAAAAAASJY/YuexHojVwYI/s672-no/IMG_5697.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I got home I had a tea and some sugar cookies. Not like I was ever going to escape those. I think every day of the holidays should include some amount of cookies. 
Not pictured are the copious cups of coffee I’ve been drinking, and the small mountain of other sweets I’ve been enjoying since everyone is in a baking mood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A merry, merry Christmas to those who celebrate it! I hope you all get wonderful gifts tomorrow, and stay close to family. While I rocked the gift giving and receiving today, tomorrow I get the best gift ever, because J lands in Chicago to spend the week with me. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are you hoping to receive? What’s the best gift you’re giving? Have you eaten as much delicious food as I have recently?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Weekend Recap - Family Baking Time</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greetings from Chicago. I’m finally home for the holidays. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you ever have really terrible ideas you don’t realize are terrible until after you’re stuck? Welcome to me, with my flight home. For some reason, I thought it was a great idea to go with the cheapest Southwest one I could find. Which meant on Saturday, I was on a plane from 2:00pm-8:30pm. Total day killer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made up for my Saturday’s transgressions by spending time with family. I did some last minute shopping, and came across this train. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-mOyMJNq6oEg/VJeI4In2bkI/AAAAAAAARvM/TGSSp70rkVM/w593-h716-no/IMG_5489.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;kay in train&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wouldn’t have even noticed the train, or sat in it, or even posted about it, if it didn’t have a very very angry sign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sign said, and I quote “CHILDREN ONLY IN SEAT. NO CLIMBING OR HANGING. DO NOT DAMAGE. VIDEO MONITORING PRESENT!!!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Post shopping, all the girls in the family (and my surprisingly-jaunty-after-getting-his-intestines-removed brother.) got together to bake and decorate cookies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-nTZomQUI-qc/VJhSN1L1XjI/AAAAAAAARw4/CoIs0vbz_EM/w896-h672-no/cookiecollage.png&quot; alt=&quot;cookie making&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The women in my family have been baking cookies since I was 4. Each year we end up taking on more and more cookies varieties (fortunately, we keep adding women to the family, by love or by birth). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/FbiuN6F-wgkBHZsQPPWa27A9pTzo2xL_wOf69t5pEeET=w586-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;The cookie table&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone’s cookies represent their individual baking, decorating or eating style. My youngest cousin topped everything in sprinkles, I used a small star point to fill my cookies, and my grandma dipped everything in chocolate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notable cookies are the “Pokeball” sugar cookie, and the “I will kill u” star. We’re not murderers here, it’s just that my brother is very allergic to red dye, and so my sister (who has a mean hand with a piping bag) always makes a few sarcastic cookies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/FzE2HOdWqq9znzkRJhaqvaz7fluACFlrgRbGvHyZgqJ9=w896-h672-no&quot; alt=&quot;i will kill u&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 5 hours of flour, sugar, butter, and love. We finally finished and took a quick photo of the gang. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-5z031tOPR-U/VJePlVNXwLI/AAAAAAAARts/_OmUO5o7uEs/w955-h716-no/IMG_5567.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Candid family photo&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s memories like these that you don’t forget. Partially because it’s so much fun, and partially because that red frosting is never coming out of the carpet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does your family do for the holidays? Do you have a “signature” cookie?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Christmas Decorations for Apartments - The Washi Tape Tree</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I live in a tiny little studio, I affectionately call the cardboard box. Housing prices are crazy in the Bay Area, so even if you have a relatively good job, you’re basically stuck with a room in an apartment from the late 1800s (beautiful victorians), or a unit in a complex built in the 1950s (ugly concrete/stucco boxes). I have the latter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, our complex manager offered 100 dollars off January’s rent to anyone who decorated their apartment’s exterior. While some of the units have small yards, big windows, and cute entryways, my exterior is basically just a door. Decorating for apartments is hard enough, can&amp;#39;t paint, can&amp;#39;t leave a mark, no giant tear down DIY projects. So here’s how I made it work. (Because let’s be real, I am motivated by money!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-CP0iEL7rgA4/VJRlTKNfWUI/AAAAAAAARbk/vESJfjF88do/w915-h1256-no/IMG_5464.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my washi tape tree door. I don’t have any electrical outlets around my building, so I couldn’t really do a beautiful light display. And I’m shelling out for gifts right now, so I didn’t want to drop a ton of cash on decorations. The solution? Washi tape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Washi tape is thin, colored, plastic-y tape that originated in Japan. It’s kind of like, thin plastic painter’s tape, or masking tape. It definitely doesn’t have the holding power of like, duct tape, but it comes in the most beautiful array of colors and patterns. And best of all, scotch is carrying it now, so I found a bunch of them at target, and staples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-2kDRd_AgUZc/VJRlWp7S14I/AAAAAAAARbs/-S-1YQkNx8s/w915-h686-no/IMG_5467.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had seen a lot of small, desk decoration type, washi tape trees on the internet. And decided to do it on a bigger scale. I basically freehanded the tree, and then added the decorations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the mini ball ornaments, I tried a tree with tinsel. While I loved the tinsel texture, the weight of the garland made it so I had to constantly add more tape to it. And the abstract and messy nature of tinsel took away from the tree shape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/NXVEprJ1XeHMONXGU9TLR9bzAA2jwavX1NKwCDaRB34S=w915-h1083-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Washi tape’s major benefit to me, is that it doesn’t (or hasn’t) damaged my door in any way. I removed the garland with no sticky residue, and no paint pulled up. It’s a fun way to decorate, or let kids decorate the walls, door, etc, without having to worry about damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-eC8RF79_6YA/VJRlVr62qaI/AAAAAAAARb0/ariC5Dm-StM/w915-h694-no/IMG_5466.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, it was an incredibly cheap option. Less than 15 dollars. I spent ~3 dollars per roll of tape, ~50 cents for the bows, and ~4 dollars for a bag of mini ornaments. (To be fair, I had the cord from another project, so the string didn’t cost me any money.) And even better, I’ve finally met my neighbors because people keep stopping by to ask me about it. (Probably because they too want the 100 dollar credit, but I’ll blame it on my art skills.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How are you decorating this year? Have you used washi tape before?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>WIAW, Holiday Photos Edition</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indulge me for a minute, before I get to my normal daily eats. I want to share some of the pictures that came back from the holiday parties we went to last weekend. When I was going through the album for the entire party, it’s all cute couples pictures, standing together, hugging, kissing, and then you get to me and J.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;J is one of the coolest guys ever (in my book), because while I’m only showing you two of the shots we got back, there are 10, and he worked it in every single one. I love a man who will strike ridiculous poses with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-YNxIk8JWTNU/VJB_PTQnwhI/AAAAAAAARM4/d1oQAUSVPqQ/w915-h610-no/kittholidayparty6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-hLkDaErBrO8/VJB_QthNzOI/AAAAAAAARM8/BC2a2PDzFk4/w915-h610-no/kittholidayparty8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, back to the eats!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I obviously had a little bit of a sweet tooth today. So enjoy what happens when craving attack. &lt;a href=&quot;http://peasandcrayons.com/2014/12/wiaw-204.html&quot;&gt;What I ate Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve followed along, you know that my breakfast is usually bagged eggs and fruit. (Sexy, I know). But, I switched it up a bit this morning with steel cut oats, topped with cinnamon, ground flax, cranberries, raisins, toasted coconut and a little nugget or two of brown sugar. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/hJ9dLEWW67Y5OVrfOYXAGOpfsqKki5mC0JAg2dDm4656=w915-h984-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My lunch has been salad focused. So here is a big salad with miso dressing along with a few slices of tuna maki. I didn’t eat the matcha rice pictured, I don’t have anything against eating it, except I don’t really enjoy the texture of rice unless it’s masked by something much more delicious, like raw tuna.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-UeZGcLDiQQo/VIC5oWGyzCI/AAAAAAAAQIQ/uGlZ4aJBomQ/w914-h541-no/IMG_5027.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Post lunch, team froyo. It’s hard to tell, but this is actually vanilla yogurt, mixed with a chocolate banana (made with actual banana) “soft serve”. I then topped it with sprinkles and white chocolate shavings. My sister has told me before that serving it in this tiny cup is an embarrassment of ice cream. I sort of agree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/mNuaGgKPmxGVTFfCgW9HTK0JXlrNo85SGTCC6sCh5wwo=w915-h882-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A sneaky selfie of me and an “Apple Pear”. Whatever these fruit are, they’re in season, I’ve probably had one daily. I’ve had to get a bowl to catch the serious amount of juice in this fruit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/roI7cTmT6un63AgbuIgJbe9k9vMmkNC4lnMv6Jd9UbpK=w915-h1075-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a shot cup of a bunch of chocolate covered almonds. Delicious. I probably need to cut these out of my daily eats. They’re so delicious, but I think every time I go grab a cup, another almond sneaks it’s way in. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-xpbgRcVJ3Cq2xZLWCj8y5xpb05iTT1do6rROEp7t6CF=s915-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also ate an orange, later that night. But I’ll admit this was a pretty protein free, sugar filled day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m inclined to fix that stuff up after the New Year, but honestly, if this is my average day moving through the holidays. I’m pretty thrilled. My biggest goals over the next three weeks are to move a bunch, and to not eat an entire tray of cookies unless it’s worth it. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you crave? Do you have a signature pose for photobooths? I swear when they count down, I never know how to pose!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Sevenly CauseBox Review where I tell you how much I loved it.</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ll admit, I kind of love subscription boxes. It seems backwards, not knowing what you’re getting when you pay for it. But, as an adult buying boring things like ziploc bags, and dishwasher liquid, sometimes, online shopping gets boring. So subscription boxes are the closest thing I can get to buying myself presents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been loving &lt;a href=&quot;sevenly.org&quot;&gt;Sevenly&lt;/a&gt; forever. They have the softest, most flattering shirts ever and they let me feel as if I’m helping people at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when they launched a quarterly box of products that benefit good causes, not gonna lie I bought a year of it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/VVMY7o2A5N-yFKHjazvYSSIjA8MFgEhWgf51wHmcrHY0=w1036-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;The box&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got the box at work today, and it was a little beat up. But I&amp;#39;m not one to judge a book by it&amp;#39;s cover (at least when it comes to boxes I really really want to open), I am one however to take photos on a black background with a white blog. Ooops!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing I got out of the box was a super cute pack of Thank You notes. They&amp;#39;re printed in LA and gorgeous photos. But the best part is that it comes with a wax seal. If you get a random thank you in the next year, it&amp;#39;s because all I want to do now is press wax letter seals now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the unopened package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/hsS7v61BGcSdmTxhFBqYapWJeVg9wBJ4bObuKppoQvcl=s716-no&quot; alt=&quot;First package of thank you notes&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The four cards. They&amp;#39;re post card format, I can&amp;#39;t wait to send them. Although, I&amp;#39;m not sure if anyone&amp;#39;s thankful for cold weather scenes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-3KAsUrBfwcE/VI-8cyvixNI/AAAAAAAARG4/_NmWDkJURqY/s716-no/IMG_5364.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Cards and the stamp&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here&amp;#39;s the stamp and wax up close. I love that the stamp says &amp;quot;thx&amp;quot;. But now I&amp;#39;m going to want one for all my letters, not just my thank you cards. I&amp;#39;ll have to find one with a heart, or a star, or my name, which might be a little self inflated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/gZeM2EEF4SN4NdiwZiDgZHxCXHXpJNXYgFum1lcyzMSq=w895-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;Stamp pattern and envelope&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next part of the box was the Sevenly Change for Change jar. One of J and my&amp;#39;s ultimate first world problems is that J hates having change in his pockets, wallet, car, etc. So I dump all the change in my purse. Last time I emptied my purse I had 17 dollars in coins in it. Now I have somewhere more reasonable to drop my change than empty candle jars. And I&amp;#39;ll feel guilted into donating it. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-2CZlFZZi980/VI-8xCzounI/AAAAAAAARGA/dupxsBcYgGo/w800-h716-no/IMG_5381.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Cutest change jar&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An adorable handwoven scarf. I need more solid, plain scarves. When all your scarves have birds, or chains, or prints on them, they get harder to wear with other things. :) Love this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-xK0M_5B_f1s/VI-86R72lGI/AAAAAAAARGY/nddDfTPheWc/w799-h716-no/IMG_5397.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Scarf&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorite piece was a little tiny elephant necklace. I&amp;#39;ve been wearing it already, it&amp;#39;s the perfect length, and it sits super flat on my neck, which is so amazing. But. Elephants are my favorite animals ever. So this was basically made for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/PbeCMcJT32U7954ur7V2-OrWKw2qrm6kcgN45HEBnUsJ=w679-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;A little tiny elephant necklace&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A tiny purse I&amp;#39;m going to use as a makeup bag for flights and traveling in between J and my places. It&amp;#39;s much much prettier than it looks in the photos. And it&amp;#39;s the perfect size for travel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/dGh61TRQd-LR_M9-dH66pC2gtUMyNLJmcVKr-kzpZG88=w933-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;Little baby purse&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And last but not least, the snacks! Delicious little cacao nibs, and a glorified granola bar. They&amp;#39;re both gluten free, and the nibs are delicious. The bar I&amp;#39;m saving for my flight home for the holidays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-fdt4YHAxw_I/VI-8sSU5NYI/AAAAAAAARF4/XnvxwSxofkw/w619-h716-no/IMG_5377.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Snacks&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, this is one of the few boxes where I actually felt like the amount I paid was pretty well reflected in the final product. I&amp;#39;ve seen a lot of make-up/beauty subscription boxes and while I love the idea, I just don&amp;#39;t need another lip gloss, or face moisturizer. So the items in those boxes often end up being not worth the product for me. But I actually plan on using all the items in this one. Sorry friends, I won&amp;#39;t be regifting. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought this myself, but Sevenly is cool. I just happened to really like it, and I love finding new subscription boxes, so I figured I&amp;#39;d share it with you. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you subscribe to any subscriptions? (I also love &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.footcardigan.com/&quot;&gt;Foot Cardigan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stitchfix.com/&quot;&gt;Stitch Fix&lt;/a&gt;) What&amp;#39;s the best gift you&amp;#39;ve gotten yourself?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Weekend Festivities</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I was a little kid, I had some serious expectations of who I’d end up as as an adult. I imagined have a seriously fabulous life, like the people (or let’s be real, characters) in most of the early 2000s reality shows. While sometimes, the inner 13 year old in me is sometimes disappointed my life didn’t turn out like Laguna Beach (the 24 year old in me is not disappointed. At all.), sometimes I have a weekend that makes me feel like my life is not too far away from a faked reality tv show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It started with two Christmas parties. That looked something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-GmXXmpKXm3o/VI8QlQ0TniI/AAAAAAAAQ3I/SunxVNHcRnI/w670-h447-no/7sutcy0774.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or maybe this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-tTLFJjbVXLQ/VI8QlTCj6nI/AAAAAAAAQ3A/nvcLV5UmUnQ/w670-h447-no/7sutcy0780.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;J’s party had that adorable gif making photo booth, on top of a taco bar, a slider bar, an open bar, and a cookie decorating bar. :) Full disclosure, I am a terrible, terrible gingerbread person decorator, but a wonderful gingerbread eater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/K7uLYS7RfS_ZJG4abwW4U1DoFOcHE392q1QGYvNawrAk=w914-h502-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike the celebs, this basic b wore the same outfit both nights. If I’m honest, it was even the same look both nights. I screenshotted a snap to cherish the moment. I’ll have even more crazy photobooth photos soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Tq_KuR-OnYgeQwCAZqzehgHFM-G7FhW1h26p1VqX0hRD=w640-h1136-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After downing cake pops, charcuterie, alcohol laden hot chocolate, and much much more. (Like, you don’t even want to know how much more). I realized I needed to get off the holiday party buzz with some serious sweating, and healthy eating. So I signed myself up for a local 5k the morning after our second holiday party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/XDsv8bsLY-fjdA0ZJKq3rz5Gp9N1LFhLkPhs0cpyZoD1=s915-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best idea ever. The race was a serious blast, and I completed in a pretty reasonable time for a still kind of boozy 5k. 27:50. After the run, I hopped in the car with &lt;a href=&quot;//www.almostgettingittogether.com&quot;&gt;Cassie&lt;/a&gt;, and we met &lt;a href=&quot;//www.instagram.com/ginamarie_hlc&quot;&gt;Gina&lt;/a&gt; for brunch and a stroll around the dish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/8rvnSNVpAi_aCCUiGo9vwRauDB9PCnVYDgSnCDTKrkP7=w527-h450-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last, but not least (and possibly most delicious). The girls and I grabbed freezes at Pressed Juicery. Their vanilla almond milk, made into a smooth frozen yogurt, is maybe the best thing I ate all weekend, even including the cake pops. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I literally want to eat this every day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/cuHmOC0XapeIOLUDcurJnkAxjxQMJZZIO03y6_SUwV4g=w838-h1355-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How was your weekend? Do you have any holiday party plans? &lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warning. Animated gif heavy post. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2014/12/11/bayareastorm-best-social-media-posts-capture-rain-wind-and-flooding/&quot;&gt;pouring in the Bay Area&lt;/a&gt; right now. Fortunately, I was able to make it to work without a canoe. Unfortunately, most of my coworkers would have needed some sort of water transportation to get here, and so, I’m nearly alone in the office (I count 15 people, usually there are ~200). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the bright side, my work is super cool, and so today, we converted one of the office spaces into a skating rink. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-74mQhc9RIkY/VIojEOpknFI/AAAAAAAAQVY/t1EQkJkMyg0/w202-h358-no/skategif.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot contain my excitement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-7YWJeohmnqw/VIoZ-EaH_zI/AAAAAAAAQUw/VJxC-hCzdwU/w1033-h775-no/IMG_5122.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “rink”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, first things first. It’s technically not “ice”. It’s a polymer, that they cover with vegetable oil, to make a slick skating surface. When you’re on it, it’s a lot less slippery than ice. I stepped on expecting to immediately bite it, but instead, I spent 10 minutes waddling around trying to figure out how hard I had to push to skate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-m93QyKE7PAU/VIolvZgq5HI/AAAAAAAAQVs/pM2_DI11qUQ/w359-h202-no/skating2.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My coworker figured out the mechanics a lot faster than me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was actually a lot more tiring than it looks, because it’s not ice, you have to use a lot of effort to get enough momentum to skate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between the fake snow, the pop-up ice rink, and the churros and mexican hot chocolate provided, we had a blast. At one point my team even had the whole rink to ourselves. It made me want to head out to a real ice rink this winter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/g23oRQyY1tqctjRYnAwO-Na2mTJ9mZ-zVE9BxndYFoO0=w915-h1220-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another image of me being excessively excited. When you live in an area that never feels like winter. (It’s a balmy 60 degrees with rain), it’s nice to have a little fake snow and ice to make it feel like the holidays. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How’s your workday (or home day) going? Are you good at skating? &lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Woah, it’s almost Christmas. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lately, I’ve been a blur of holiday shopping, project finishing, and Christmas partying this week (J and I have a holiday bash every night this week from Wednesday on. Since they’re all through work, it’s a lot of free delicious food and booze around. Yum, and also yikes!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-_BZBuJgFq_s/VIf3a9BKLhI/AAAAAAAAQJk/lEyrZkgoGb4/s672-no/holidayparty.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A friend and I from last year’s holiday party. It’s my one excuse to wear a gorgeous dress in San Francisco. I’ll definitely be snapping photos this year too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I wanted to step away from the December madness to bring you what I’m eating before all these festivities. So let’s get down to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://peasandcrayons.com/2014/12/ate-wednesday-party-203.html&quot;&gt;Wednesday eats&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Breakfast is back with the best bagged eggs I’ve ever had. This is actually my most solid breakfast. I sometimes switch it up with the work buffet breakfast (usually a vegan pancake, eggs, and a slice of bacon.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ZSGU7kRbZXw/VIfzYmjuOzI/AAAAAAAAQII/jW07GwjHfa0/w832-h672-no/IMG_5087.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Least sexy picture of the year award goes to my lunch. Lately, my goal has been to eat more vegetables. So the solution, and trick to this, is to always eat whatever my lunch is, over a salad. I have a bunch of friends who do this, and I just never caught on. However, it makes my pie-less chicken pot pie look rather unappetizing. Despite its looks, it was delicious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/sswe8KyKllXY4ZRPFM8QXh4vnhoBfOByiW-hpjJXeAnW=w807-h672-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this photo, I&amp;#39;m straight up clawing my afternoon snack. I’ve been craving chocolate lately, and this chocolate covered coconut snack is amazing, and in small enough portions that I don’t eat an entire coconut’s worth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/5bVQvp7q5p5osMWowky1lKUkBJ8S7cMBWO-VL-FM7OQg=s672-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not much of a dinner person, but I met up with a friend for the vietnamese version of Chipotle. Which features yet another salad. Totally delicious. J and I have had this once before, and I literally can recommend everything I’ve had provided you like avocado, jalapeno, cilantro and pineapple. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/jakvuyWrhayTazahy7L1dtx1azaGvUDd3s5cIjE-ebC_=w896-h672-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not a bad day! I think I’m due to eliminate some more sugar from my everyday eats, but otherwise I’m more satisfied with the food I’m sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I definitely need to sit down and write some more things up. I recently got eyelash extensions (love), am decorating my teeny tiny apartment’s exterior for a contents (bring on the washi tape), and hit up a giant craft fair with a bunch of friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you prepared for the holidays? Any killer parties, or traditions I should start? I think I need to start a baking list for when I go back home. Anything (healthy, or less healthy) I should look into? :)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>#WeAreThankful</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve looked at your calendar, or don’t live under a rock, you know that Thanksgiving has already passed us by. But today, at work, I was grabbing lunch with a friend who works on the events team. In a nutshell, her job is to throw super amazing parties, lunches, and holiday celebrations for the company. Despite all the perks of her job (getting attend lavish parties, sweet relationships with cool vendors, etc), she told me she feels best about what she does when people thank her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it made me realize, omg, I never even sat down and thought about all the things, and more importantly people, I’m grateful for this year. Fortunately &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.hioscar.com/post/103736729575/we-are-thankful&quot;&gt;Oscar Insurance&lt;/a&gt; reached out to me to ask me what I’m thankful about, and inspired me with the hashtag #WeAreThankful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;#39;s talk gratitude: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;1. Family (and the fact they put up with me).&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I convinced the family this year to do a 5k after the holidays. And even though my brother has a surgery coming up in the next few weeks, he was &lt;strong&gt;still&lt;/strong&gt; down to do it. They definitely have my back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-BPJl219cm9I/VHpZ0i19_JI/AAAAAAAAPiI/kwl7XJAtN1Q/w955-h716-no/IMG_4925.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Family from the ugly sweater race&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;2. Figuring out my health. &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before this year, I had never run a half, a 10k, or even a real 5k. I hadn’t ever gone to yoga more than an errant time or two. I liked hiking, biking, and sports. But I avoided so many things for fear of being bad at them. This last year, I stopped worrying about looking silly trying something new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/npoqIOVPC3Lo2xFyeAOs3M_6uqB5N6AUc9uUOfKFT3I=w520-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;Kay stretching&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;3. Duh. J.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He actually coded most of this blog, takes a bunch of the pictures, and goes along with 90% of the things I do. (Still can’t convince him into yoga. :( ) He’s basically the coolest person I know. I haven’t killed him after a 3 week road trip, him teaching me to ski, or even after he told me I had a “pizza belly” a few nights ago. So basically it’s love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-vUqCljSsNTY/VB-ogFnFNKI/AAAAAAAALVM/dmZq7yQr17U/w1035-h690-no/IMG_0719.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;J&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;4. This blog!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes (maybe most of the time) I’m a terrible blogger. I take bad quality iPhone pictures, neglect to post, and even sometimes let my comments build up forever. But this blog has also been the coolest thing ever. I take more pictures, I’ve tried new things, and I’ve met the most fun people ever just by being on the internet. I’m thankful for everyone who reads this, and all the really amazing ladies I comment back and forth with. You guys make the good old world wide web fun. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-__2-Y1MZaLI/VGmVwk204DI/AAAAAAAAOwg/ZXia62frizA/w955-h716-no/2014-11-16.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;This blog&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m thankful for a lot more things (like the good old job, the fact that I can get my hands on the ground in a forward fold, and that my eyeliner looks pretty darn good most days.) And it’s important to consider all the things we’re grateful for before we step into the busiest, and most consumeristic time of the year. (No judgement here, I’m straight up buying everything this Christmas.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though we’ve already eaten all the turkey, cranberry sauce, and paleo pumpkin pie (j/k, maybe), what are you thankful for?&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t one of those amazing people who only indulged a little over Thanksgiving break. I wasn’t even one of those amazing people who only indulged over Thanksgiving. When I went home, it was serious sugar coma, food party, every single day. And it was amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made, and ate a bunch of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.averiecooks.com/2013/10/candy-corn-and-white-chocolate-softbatch-cookies.html&quot;&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; cookies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/JX0-DdzwpBC0TUVK9XTWfPyipt7LmKqmY4jLAiPdnJY=w955-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But by the last day I was pretty beat. I was feeling pretty sluggish, sleepy, and fat. So I’ve been trying to tighten up my weekly eats to balance out all my dirty habits. (Also, full disclosure, my brother is proposing to his girlfriend, there’s gonna be a wedding. I want to look good in the photos next year!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;#39;s what I ate &lt;a href=&quot;http://peasandcrayons.com/2014/12/ate-wednesday-202.html&quot;&gt;Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Breakfast was this mondo cup of coffee, (necessary), some hardboiled eggs (which look very very plain in a white bowl), and a pink lady apple. I love and hate this breakfast. Love the way it makes me feel, hate that it’s sooooo boring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-q0fBdeIzN70/VH9yoHZ94FI/AAAAAAAAP1c/qM_4eLabwOc/w985-h716-no/IMG_5020.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Breakfast&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lunch salad. Pretty normal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/z-8ImxGxIRsYXrsTsshHWFmmqk5qTaRiohGBUcf6VDE=w915-h686-no&quot; alt=&quot;Salad&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fancy soup. This was…. carrot ginger I think. I’ve been eating a bunch of soup. My bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-CfDZuFSp9As/VH6hYcBRnuI/AAAAAAAAP00/_OVAV2SniFw/w955-h716-no/IMG_4994.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Soup&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My drink of choice lately. Hint fizz. This stuff, this is the best cold drink lately (peppermint tea being the best hot drink.) If you’re in the Bay Area, or really anywhere, you should try this. It’s like, bottled spa water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/7wCcG6ITXf499nKbPIz11yN4v8zbXzOz97efbrC8xnc=w471-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;hint&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My snack. These nuts are… meh. I want to whip up some energy bites or something this week to replace these guys. I’m just not a peanut person. Why eat peanuts when you could have cashews, almonds, or macadamia nuts? Idk man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/30T-MAGx-KpIQevJDO3XBAnQpnG_-6sABVNvr3TBSfk=w494-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dinner was another salad with pulled pork. But I was lazy, and talking to people so I didn’t snap a photo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unrelated to eats. But I’ve been listening to this a bunch while getting ready or working. To be frank, it’s officially because it’s my boyfriend’s band playing it. But if you like the garage rock type of sound, it’s worth a listen. Otherwise abort. Honestly. I mostly listen to pop and like maybe venture into indie when I’m feeling daring. I always feel a little more cultured when I go to a show with J, or listen to something outside my listening comfort zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe class=&#39;yt&#39; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/kXxbK23WnJA&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you switch your food up, or do you eat the same thing every day? What are you listening to that I should listen to? (Hint, if it’s Hozier, I’m allllllready listening. :) )&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>No longer MIA!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;True Life: I was a total recluse over Thanksgiving week. Basically. Sorry I disappeared over the break. It wasn’t that I was doing anything particularly exotic, or time consuming. Mostly. I just wanted a week off from everything. I wanted to sit in freezing Chicago, eat food, watch my siblings play video games, and just like turn my mind off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So. Here are the mindless things I did in my time away. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walked a silly 5k.  My brother is on doctor’s orders not to run. So my sister and I hammed it up throughout the race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-25e6aN_e9Rc/VH5hVDR6AAI/AAAAAAAAPvQ/1NRIGcak72I/w915-h610-no/race_641_photo_13793359.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baked a ton of cookies. If you saw what I was eating this weekend, it would have been #fatfluential. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.averiecooks.com/2013/10/candy-corn-and-white-chocolate-softbatch-cookies.html&quot;&gt;This recipe&lt;/a&gt; plus any additions is basically perfection.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/flMf9v8IxzFiEpwkHh9KqtDf4Z3AK5zJGConm1LX_94=w915-h953-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kitty sat this little munchkin, who’s literally a munchkin kitten. Every time I get near a cat or a dog, I get serious pet envy and end up browsing Pet Finder for a week. Bad life choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/PY_jvLXyUWJd4G3R8svPQy4FnGkj5QDIyjKjVqxZji0=w914-h638-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hung with the family. Most of this time was spent in straight up sweatpants with a cookie in one hand and coffee in the other. To spare you from that picture. Here’s a snapchat from the morning’s run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-tKYEjUKgd4k/VHpZYZPwKeI/AAAAAAAAPe8/DmOKY4zvetI/w914-h515-no/IMG_4908.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a blast. But I have to say. I missed looking at this. It’s nice to be back somewhere where the sun shines. (Even though today it is pouring in SF. Hello 3 hour commute and flooded roads.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Ya6TK_uYbU0/VHpXdKxeE3I/AAAAAAAAPQ4/SPJSDEzye6k/s915-no/IMG_4832.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How is your life lately? Did you cook, bake, stuff your face with anything for the holidays? &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Weekend Recap!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crazy week everyone. I swear, once we get into the week of Thanksgiving, everything goes by so fast. Work is busy, life is busy, weekends are busy. Blogs are neglected! I’m catching up with everything, but I wanted to show off my weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Embarrassingly, I was having so much fun this weekend that I neglected to photograph most of it. I’d like to blame my roof, dinner, and drinks drinking. But that’s unfair. Mostly I was just too busy talking or sweating to take photos. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First. I found and purchased Coconut La Croix. Fyi, for those curious, it’s definitely sweet coconut flavor, not like, sparkling coconut water. It’s delicious, and I’m depraved so I took a bunch of selfies with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-749YElqnPcw/VG98q0_EIWI/AAAAAAAAPFU/-L6U6vEOomU/s672-no/IMG_4779-MIX.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like it, and I want to make a cocktail out of it basically. It’s kind of a perfect pina colada base. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning I spent picnicing on &lt;a href=&quot;//www.almostgettingittogether.com&quot;&gt;Cassie’s&lt;/a&gt; roof. It was amazing, filled with wine, almonds, popcorn, cheese and really really delicious crackers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I skipped out for a bit and got my nails done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Kb8g2v_QWkhoxYBV6piW6QtW-bwLtCPP45guxJANXl4=w600-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shakira, my nail bff, is literally the best gel nails of my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I met back up with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.almostgettingitogether.com&quot;&gt;Cassie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.instagram.com/ginamarie_hlc&quot;&gt;Gina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thehealthymaven.com&quot;&gt;Davida&lt;/a&gt;, and Davida’s boyfriend for dinner. We grabbed some pretty delicious Japanese food at Chotto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/3i-e9adLTdEoaRoruobJUn8Ji-Wo1V5l2peQEG4-8O8=w640-h522-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lighting was bad but the sushi and drinks were delicious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunday I hit up some adorable boutiques in the city. I spent most of my day wishing my teeny tiny studio apartment had room for a card wall:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/nR6pU8SvtbgdVKxZGSKdXQcMg5bFTNeOqR8VR38CPPA=w955-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A small child to dress in adorable clothing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And more room in my freezer for sweet potato soft serve:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended the evening with a hot yoga class that &lt;a href=&quot;//www.almostgettingittogether.com&quot;&gt;Cassie&lt;/a&gt; found. Fortunately, there is no photographic evidence of this because it was so hot, and I was so sweaty by end, that I’m pretty sure I looked like a wet dog. Beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How was your weekend? Are you feeling the holiday time crunch!?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>WIAW</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s &lt;a href=&quot;//www.peasandcrayons.com&quot;&gt;Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; again. And if I could describe my week in one badly taken selfie, it would probably look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-eWSO5bbBf7o/VFkVhg0N5_I/AAAAAAAAPAk/he_7vYRZpRs/w434-h716-no/IMG_4240.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of times, when you see WIAW, you get the most beautiful food of someone’s day. And trust me, I’m going to give you that. But I’m also going to give you my not so great food either. (Although due to the fact that I literally snarfed it up as soon as I got my hands on it, no photo evidence exists.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But let’s start with the good. My morning started with Pumpkin Chia Seed Pudding. I’m really feeling chia seed pudding, and I can make it the night before, so it works great. I’ll put up a recipe as soon as my camera is here. :) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-FWR91pPXUDc/VGY-RMOWsQI/AAAAAAAAO_g/Pq0R5luigKo/w752-h716-no/IMG_4516.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Pumpkin Chia Seed Pudding&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pumpkin version was… probably good if you love pumpkin. It tasted like pumpkin pie filling to me, but I realized, I’m not a huge “real pumpkin flavor” kind of girl. I want the fakey-fake pumpkin syrup taste. Ooops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lunch was amazing. Little tacos and a salad. They had chopped, roasted, delicata squash, and it was a great topper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/hYu-mbuHrJfA-LhgQtEjyMIGVRR_WBqrbH7z3UGVKSk=w1018-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;tacos and salad&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lately, to get myself away from my desk, I go grab a spot of froyo. This was a pear-apple blend, with sprinkles for cuteness, and marshmallows because they taste amazing cold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-dqK7DArD4M0/VGqznuAIspI/AAAAAAAAO-k/NCkE6pPAqd8/w911-h716-no/IMG_4744.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;froyo&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mid-day snack. Some Oloves. Basically olives. They’re so good, and such adorable travel packs. I die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-GV3cRYUf3gA/VGuEUuwjOcI/AAAAAAAAO9Q/ayN00B9Bw9o/w809-h716-no/IMG_4747.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Oloves&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, a bowl of popcorn at home. Yum&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/KY8auUnHmJIrCAsopI8x_6sf_s8U3AyHr6hzi_kTiSg=w847-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that would be a usual day, maybe add another snack, or fruit, if I didn’t discover a giant dispenser of 61% cacao, chocolate covered almonds at work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No joke, I probably ate like 30. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now I have a stomach ache, a really delicious stomach ache. And I need someone to wipe my brain so that I don’t know that these beasts are less than 10 minutes away from me. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hahaha. Just kidding about the memory wiping. They were a good treat. But definitely a little over kill on the portion control. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How was your week of eats? Is there some delicious delicious snack you can’t just have one of? What are you cooking lately?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>All the fours survey</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brrr. It&amp;#39;s the first cold morning in my house. I&amp;#39;ve been dragging my little space heater around everywhere I go, and drinking tea like it&amp;#39;s going out of style or something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve seen this survey around a bunch, and I was tagged over the weekend to do it by &lt;a href=&quot;http://sweetsandbeets.com/&quot;&gt;Emily at Sweets and Beets&lt;/a&gt;, her blog is super cute, you should totally check it out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Four Names That People Call Me (Other Than My Real Name):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Hurricane. (I was not always a neat person)&lt;br&gt;
2) Katie (Kathryn is the full name)&lt;br&gt;
3) Melissa (because someone has mistaken me for my best friend)&lt;br&gt;
4) Jolly Green Giant (7th grade is not a good time for nick names)  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-YJ2uS3q-JNw/VGrsuvqmNEI/AAAAAAAAO8M/_VKLCLQYxyw/w600-h672-no/kayandmelissa.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
BFFs who apparently look similar from behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Four Jobs I’ve Had:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) I was a concession, box office, clean up worker at a movie theater. There were probably 2 years of my life where I only smelled of butter.&lt;br&gt;
2) Waitress and Bartender at Chilis&lt;br&gt;
3) Sandwich maker. This was a low point in my life, the deli made such good cookies, and we could take as many as we wanted home after work.&lt;br&gt;
4) Software engineer. My post college job. :)  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-g8DNnMgyyxY/VGrZtpj5WnI/AAAAAAAAO5A/O9EzAUM6eVM/w448-h672-no/cooking-class.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hilariously, while most of my other jobs had serious food prep, this cooking was a fun trip for my software engineering work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/zNXOvBa4U3Os7SgjV_CCEtGb3dOO8e2zKmiBi9jRQW4=w448-h543-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Four Movies I Have Watched More Than Once:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Mean Girls. I’m terrible about watching movies… I only can think of one.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Four Books I’d Recommend:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Cats-Cradle-Novel-Kurt-Vonnegut/dp/038533348X&quot;&gt;Cat’s Cradle by Kurt Vonnegut&lt;/a&gt; (Let’s get the real serious literary one out of the way)&lt;br&gt;
2) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Bittersweet-A-Novel-Miranda-Beverly-Whittemore-ebook/dp/B00GQAOL6W&quot;&gt;Bittersweet by Miranda Beverly-Whittemore&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
3) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/The-Hangmans-Daughter-Tale-Book-ebook/dp/B003P9XMFI&quot;&gt;The Hangman&amp;#39;s Daughter by Oliver Pötzsch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
4) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Reconstructing-Amelia-Novel-Kimberly-McCreight-ebook/dp/B0089LOMAG&quot;&gt;Reconstructing Amelia by Kimberly McCreight&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Four Places I’ve Lived:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Naperville, Illinois.&lt;br&gt;
2) Kirkland, Washington.&lt;br&gt;
3) Seville, Spain.&lt;br&gt;
4) San Francisco, California.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-2lYD--0MSsc/VGrZ3438Y1I/AAAAAAAAO6Y/TQBNOqh1cTY/w720-h540-no/sevilla1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The girls and I in Sevilla. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Four Places I Have Been:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) England&lt;br&gt;
2) Hawaii&lt;br&gt;
3) Costa Rica&lt;br&gt;
4) Philippines  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-FYc7SKrPXZM/VGrc04L0NrI/AAAAAAAAO7o/tU6-sohC0e4/w960-h631-no/kzipline.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Four Places I’d Rather Be Right Now:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) France! (Although I’d gain 20 pounds from croissant indulgence)&lt;br&gt;
2) Home to Chicago. Visiting family is the best.&lt;br&gt;
3) Hawaii.&lt;br&gt;
4) Montreal! (I have old friends there.)  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/lwaNly-k9HgJXhO7AKdr1KeXrj9zuWHYvUBWwHIL3rA=w1016-h672-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Missing this view right about now!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Four Things I Don’t Eat:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Calamari that still look like a squid&lt;br&gt;
2) Macaroni and Cheese&lt;br&gt;
3) Wafer Cookies&lt;br&gt;
4) Black Licorice (although I like anise. I don’t know)  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Four Of My Favorite Foods:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Brussel Sprouts&lt;br&gt;
2) Chocolate covered anything, but Brookstone’s Acai has a special place in my heart.&lt;br&gt;
3) Acai Bowls&lt;br&gt;
4) Hamburgers (I’m real classy guys)  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-TZ345zteN6E/VGrZsTBocDI/AAAAAAAAO5s/2whmQjMDgdk/w896-h672-no/coffee%2Band%2Bacai.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Four TV Shows That I Watch, or have watched:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) How to Get Away With Murder&lt;br&gt;
2) Law and Order SVU&lt;br&gt;
3) Scandal&lt;br&gt;
4) Are you the One? (My treadmill running show. Gym has free wifi)  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Four Things I Am Looking Forward To This Year:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Christmas!&lt;br&gt;
2) Running Seawheeze with my mom&lt;br&gt;
3) Going to Rugby 7s with my sister in February&lt;br&gt;
4) My next vacation. Alaska (I want to see the Aurora Borealis), Asia, Europe?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-kCDHU9n_ka0/VGrc0SZualI/AAAAAAAAO7U/sa8-24LOMow/w528-h716-no/kandsis.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Good times ahead with the sister I look nothing like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Four Things I’m Saying:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) “Oh man.”&lt;br&gt;
2) “Did you hear about…” (Some article I likely found on Facebook)&lt;br&gt;
3) “I don’t know.” (To my boyfriend who asks more questions than Who Wants to be a Millionaire ever did&lt;br&gt;
4) “Sounds good to me.” (Everyone at work says this.)  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m terrible at choosing people to tag, there&amp;#39;s too much pressure! So if you haven&amp;#39;t done this yet and want to get a little bit of reflecting in. I&amp;#39;m tagging you! (But tell me so I can check it out!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What movies should I watch more than once? If it&amp;#39;s on Netflix, bonus points. What&amp;#39;s your favorite food lately?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What about the weekend?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Woah, it&amp;#39;s already Monday. This weekend went by so fast. Here&amp;#39;s the Spark Notes version of my life the last three days. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friday night we fit in two shows that my boyfriend wanted to go to, they both started at 8. Fortunately, one band was the opener, and the other was the headliner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we started with the opener, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thecongressmusic.org/&quot;&gt;The Congress&lt;/a&gt;, one of my boyfriend’s favorite folk rock bands. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then we jetted off to see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hoodieallen.com/&quot;&gt;Hoodie Allen&lt;/a&gt;, an old, like high school old, friend of my boyfriend’s. If you haven’t heard Hoodie, I would affectionately describe his music, as white boy rap-pop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/FiCwMkmAXxh14qJBTOKKiHQGTVkMYcbMGQq7UHQuZpQ=w637-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Congress was laid back, slightly buzzed 30 and 40 somethings, so we were at least 10 years younger than most of the crowd. But Hoodie Allen was mostly high school girls, the show was a lot of jumping, cake throwing, and confetti flying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-fBdkedVh6tQ/VGmf8AZWvKI/AAAAAAAAOyQ/fXvglScu9go/w1038-h654-no/jfetti.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was almost surreal how different the two were.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saturday, J and I spent the day urban hiking. I really wanted one of the most delicious and guilty burgers that evening, and so we wanted to work off the burger in advance. We did a hilly 10 mile loop in the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/B7d8DuZ0Z_wo8I0doijKlIGc1whPFZ815SUOXNn3An0=w608-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We focused mainly on Mt. Sutro open space reserve, which gave us some pretty cool views of Sutro Towers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-wRTkYzEW9KI/VGmohKnTO2I/AAAAAAAAO0o/cWSUDJLmEHU/s716-no/sutrollage.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly. Despite our serious hike. We couldn’t get reservations for burgers. So the whole hike was for nothing. Jk. We had a lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Sunday I hung out with &lt;a href=&quot;//www.almostgettingittogether.com&quot;&gt;Cassie&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;//www.instagram.com/ginamarie_hlc&quot;&gt;Gina&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-uY_VgnshJKI/VGmVwhaKeEI/AAAAAAAAOxI/TBz2YOXa-uU/w1038-h702-no/2014-11-16.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also rocked an urban hike in the Presidio. It went by super fast thanks to a lot of venting, wine, and really amazing grapes from the farmers’ market.
It kept me close to the ocean, so I was pretty happy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/tNU7SDKcZBBmR2_wQoWvhIXIi68Hy_dag9xbq8fE5BQ=w569-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;J and I made up for a burgerless Saturday by indulging Sunday night instead. I would have a picture of my favorite burger in San Francisco. Unfortunately I literally could not wait to eat it. So I didn’t even sneak a picture. You’ll have to imagine it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How was your weekend? Ever been to a crazy show?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Pre-Holiday Musings</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Random things I’m thinking about lately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;1. Challenges&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The year is ending, and I feel like it’s one of those seasons where I start thinking: “I should improve myself!”. I’m not sure if I want to take on a sleep goal, or shoot for weight loss, or train for something, or get more flexible or… And the problem is, I kind of want to do them all. I think it’s a mix of boredom and anticipating New Years and Holidays.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously evidenced by the picture below, I could use some biceps -- guns. :)  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/sn_nBR0goVOg0bxhTzcZSdsve_BmdAB4QoG2y0_LagM=w599-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;Kay “no-guns” Bueno&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;2.  Blogging induced baking urges.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made some mediocre pancakes last night. Pumpkin protein pancakes to be specific. (Yeah, I know, we’re over pumpkin. We just saw our 8th pumpkin muffin this week. But guys, I want to be on the bandwagon too) I mean, to be real with you, I haven’t been cooking much until this whole blog thing. But now that I see it everywhere. I have the urge to put things on my stove, and in my microwave, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/6lgZSvc31SlwHc649e4-AerNhItKJDhf4Jze_n_2BiA=s716-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;3.  Christmas gifts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I have two siblings, an “adopted” sibling, my parents, my grandparents, my best friend, a handful of other friends, and my siblings’ and parent’s significant others. It’s unromantic and definitely not whimsical, but I’m going to need to make a spreadsheet soon of what I’m getting everyone. Christmas is in 40 days (or so) and that’s mind blowing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/hsuwM_SUhJitksA4yRESqYGd8PWK5xZqzwu9yVFKEb4=w537-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christmas last year, we all get themed pajamas every year!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;4.  What should I be drinking&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw a lot of people drinking the celestial seasons holiday teas. And I thought, I want some of that. So I bought it. J is making fun of me because he only drinks tea that’s leaves. Secret. I probably drink a little too much diet soda, but, I gave it up for a year, and didn’t notice a difference, so I’m back on it. I figure sugar cookie tea can’t be that much worse for you than diet rootbeer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s J and I drinking tea in the summer. It was pretty good despite the long face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-eEuKlkrzgIY/U-mST_5CtCI/AAAAAAAAG4E/MhWQ70rz6Oc/w537-h716-no/IMG_2672.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;J and I with teas&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I snuck a cup this morning. Unsurprisingly it was pretty good. Even J admitted it wasn’t that overpowering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-GMawJhQ3Dxw/VGZBcK_DE_I/AAAAAAAAOIs/xHZqeRrfl4o/w537-h716-no/IMG_4518.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s on your mind lately? Are you the type of person who makes resolutions? What do you drink at night? Help a woman out. :)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Sweat Republic Surf Set Review</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was a kid who should have been born on the water. Every time I’ve been to the ocean, for surfing, stand-up paddle boarding, or just swimming, I’ve had a blast. Maybe even the best time of my life. Unfortunately, thanks to a midwest upbringing, skin that burns at the slightest hint of sun, and the serious cost of ocean activities, I’ve never been able to actually improve my surf skills after the initial lesson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter Surf Set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Hlg3axFxiPtkNIElZuHBnwmIwLrx2x6tXBrQN4Eb1jA=w1038-h657-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of you who haven’t heard of it before, Surf Set is pretty much like surfing on land. (A lovely experience for those of us who want to avoid burns, uncomfortable wet suits, and sharks). A surf board balanced on three, bosu-like balls, mimics the instability of the ocean. The class lets you practice both moves necessary to improve surfing, but also other non-traditional strength, cardio, and flexibility building moves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://almostgettingittogether.com/surfset-review/&quot;&gt;Cassie&lt;/a&gt; and I went to a morning Surf Set class, at a super cute studio called &lt;a href=&quot;http://sweatrepublicsf.com/&quot;&gt;Sweat Republic&lt;/a&gt;, and fell in love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-mfYYDvf6rLY/VGAsnKEbw2I/AAAAAAAAN0E/eos1EQB8u-w/w955-h716-no/IMG_0482.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Excuse the extreme cheesing and the incorrect hand positioning. I need some more classes under my belt before I look good doing this. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The instructor was extremely friendly, and took a lot of time coming around to help correct poses, challenge students, and even help me jump from the ground onto a surfboard. It turns out she was actually a surfer, which reinforced the fact that this may actually help if I ever get on the water again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-SlD3yMuCT2U/VGAsjSAjK8I/AAAAAAAANzI/LzGpNT_CYRM/w955-h716-no/IMG_0474.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The class began with a quick warm up, which was primarily comprised of on the ground stretching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-PTvGEiI4jvo/VGAsinyw29I/AAAAAAAAN0w/raeZdMXIxW0/w955-h716-no/IMG_0473.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We worked our way through cardio, strength training, balancing, and a mock surf session in the hour long class. While I definitely sweat some, I felt it most the next day in my obliques. Balancing and stability are good for the abs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-O9CprsRrpvU/VGAshU5weGI/AAAAAAAAN0c/EJRvwyrHyP0/w955-h716-no/IMG_0471.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had such an amazing time. Sometimes, when I read about classes in San Francisco, and they say “All Levels”, I interpret that as “All levels of people who are already physically fit”. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As someone who has a little bit of performance anxiety This class was actually “All Levels”, there are a bunch of different ways to customize both the difficulty of the boards, and the moves involved to make it work for you. The class went by super fast, and I can&amp;#39;t wait to go again this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would you surf on land? What crazy fitness class do I need to find next in San Francisco?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What I ate Wednesday</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am going to blow your mind this week. (Maybe, probably not). If you know me, you know I don’t cook. I mean, up until yesterday I didn’t even have a can opener in my kitchen. (I bought one after I realized the only way I could open my can of coconut milk was to bludgeon it with a screw driver. Oops). This &lt;a href=&quot;http://peasandcrayons.com/&quot;&gt;Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;, I actually made some of my own food. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Breakfast:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-YmNfCoBh6NA/VFz2ONSsOyI/AAAAAAAAN90/pYXEETIdQ9M/w873-h623-no/IMG_4345.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vanilla coconut chia seed pudding. I am in love with chia seed anything, and so I decided, I had to learn to make this. I don’t have the perfect ratio for this yet (but I’m cloooose). I love my pudding a little less liquidy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lunch:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-bDlzNZbXZLg/VGJuxU9Eh4I/AAAAAAAAN9s/XRu-EiGp7mw/w873-h769-no/IMG_4459.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work lunch. This was a side salad, a cup of vegan potato leek soup, and a piece of whole wheat flatbread with chicken and bacon. Totally delicious. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Snack:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-bme3mSC815I/VF5lf3od1UI/AAAAAAAAN-E/5KWiSo-Rsgw/s873-no/IMG_4360.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. I did not eat four larabars. But it’s hard to take a picture every time I want to eat something, so this is from when I bought them. I had the carrot cake. It kinda let me down. I think I’m too much of a child. Only chocolate chip cookie for me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other snack: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-JUUbXzgPRnU/VF1pLpYDFSI/AAAAAAAAN-M/kLspILo3y-A/w873-h1164-no/IMG_4350.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone was giving out chocolate outside of my building. Yes please.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had an apple somewhere in here, but I didn’t snap a photograph. Imagine an apple. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dinner snack:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Jkyi2vHZ238/VGLUAF7AYEI/AAAAAAAAN9k/WT42_CngX3w/s873-no/IMG_4463.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t love dinner. But I do love the fact that I’m popping my own popcorn lately. I take some kernals, and coconut oil, wait for them to pop. (And also freak out when they pop. I dropped an entire spoonful of popcorn kernals on the ground when one popped in my face.) Then I smother this in nutritional yeast and a dash of salt. Delish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What have you been making lately? I&amp;#39;ve been experimenting on a peanut butter mug cake. I found the most irresistable peanut butter chips at Whole Foods this week. :)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Children of the Corn</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week a coworker told me the Guiness Book of World Record&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;//www.coolpatchpumpkins.com&quot;&gt;largest corn maze&lt;/a&gt; was just an hour away from San Francisco. 60 acres of corn confusion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not one to turn down a challenge (especially a challenge that closed this weekend), J and I got a group of friends together and spent most of our Saturday getting lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/BclFfC7sjODxIIxS1Mt03LN4eTnV_uTFXjs14v8zY5s=w955-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-BGtLWvbujb8/VGAO92BKY_I/AAAAAAAANrY/AhewLFpUbIc/w955-h716-no/IMG_4417.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The course is broken up into four different platforms, each of which runs you through a different type of maze. The first is made up of concentric circles, the second a square grid like pattern, the third, a squiggly leaf-like pattern, and the fourth a cross hatched mess. The map and course have numerical and alphabetical coordinates (e.g. L23) to try to find where you are on the map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ran into the maze foolish. In the beginning we decided not to use the map they gave us. However, after following the same circle over and over again, we took a different approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-DPXiwJ0K0I4/VF-c4nsPteI/AAAAAAAANk0/bntHV6PcFfs/w537-h716-no/IMG_4385.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;j trying to find the top&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, even after hoisting J up, we couldn&amp;#39;t find an easy way to the first base. After some splitting up and Marco Polo, we finally made it to the first platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-imHjazHhu3o/VF-eMauduwI/AAAAAAAANlM/qHEOPYff8VM/w955-h716-no/IMG_4387.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;found the first base&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, looking at the corn field, we realized we couldn&amp;#39;t really keep going without a map, or we&amp;#39;d be in the maze until it closed at 10pm. So we made it a game, and promised only to look every 3 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/hf7i36-Hl__jts6BQP62B3puc0P8hNwURpykZ8Aui7A=w1038-h630-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-P5uIdvOJ9QA/VGLWrfeb6II/AAAAAAAAN6A/YnVTZj2YT04/w537-h716-no/findtheway.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this tactic we got through the next two platforms much quicker. At the third platform though, despite the smiles here, we were kind of over tramping through corn. It turns out, unlike on a hike, a corn maze doesn&amp;#39;t look much different at any point. I had my fitbit on, and we were reaching mile 6 of walking through the maze. That&amp;#39;s a lot of corn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-jP-mgKj2f1c/VGAOr9mstdI/AAAAAAAANps/yPZjSsZwGQ8/w955-h716-no/IMG_4408.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We finally made it out at this tiny wooden bridge. We were so happy to have escaped the maze. But J was disappointed, because they weren&amp;#39;t running their hay ride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-mo5PR3SXYV8/VGAPPdsebxI/AAAAAAAANtU/6lE5ZF28Pwk/w955-h716-no/IMG_4427.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the boys made their own. I was simultaneously embarrassed (because they took over a random wagon and were running around the parking lot), and pleased, because come on, it&amp;#39;s adorable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-fbymk21vmwY/VGAPWtJ8e_I/AAAAAAAAN2E/SyAG6rlRTKY/w1038-h522-no/IMG_4433.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all the maze would have been the best ever if it was about half the length. By end we were pretty exhausted, and sick of seeing corn, and all we wanted was to pee and eat In-n-Out. Both of which we did. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s the craziest (or dumbest) thing you&amp;#39;ve done lately?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My Weekend in Four Pictures</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was one of those weekends, where you end up doing so much, you want another weekend after to relax. (In a good way!) It&amp;#39;s still in the 60s and 70s in the Bay, so I&amp;#39;m trying to get out as much as possible before the fog rolls in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/IC98GPe5mrTvPu2AD06dOdlpWi8aXf-62bp2IUsEOBs=w860-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We completed the Guinness Book of World Record’s &lt;a href=&quot;//www.coolpatchpumpkins.com&quot;&gt;longest corn maze&lt;/a&gt;. That map. That map is the maze. We died a little inside completing it, but we conquered the corn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-B76phZNHMalKnkbUFmnJRr2xqDROYiZ375T-ngbWQo=w1038-h522-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;J really wanted a hay ride to celebrate his corn maze completion. Unfortunately there wasn’t one. So we made our own. Corn Maze - 0, Kay and friends - 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Zr8h4rbF_K8/VGBHjDUlpQI/AAAAAAAAN1w/pv4jcBm7KZY/w696-h672-no/IMG_4454.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;//www.almostgettingittogether.com&quot;&gt;Cassie&lt;/a&gt; and I hung out again. It was, in a word, magical. If you don’t have a friend you can sweat with, vent to, and eat delicious food with. I totally suggest finding one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-mfYYDvf6rLY/VGAsnKEbw2I/AAAAAAAAN0E/eos1EQB8u-w/w896-h672-no/IMG_0482.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took my first Surf Set class. Love at first wipe out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to tell you all more about it (and I will later this week!), but I had to brag a little about my weekend while I’m still so pumped from it. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How was your weekend? Try anything new?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Amazon Flash Tattoos Review - Say that 10 times fast.</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today has been one of those days where all I want to do is treat myself. I may or may not have signed up for a subscription box, bought new shoes, and considered the finer points of owning adorable, hand crafted, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/listing/172817839/custom-text-cute-cat-mug-white-black&quot;&gt;cat-shaped mugs&lt;/a&gt; from Etsy. (I have yet to buy the kitty mugs, but give it a day.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I love to get packages in the mail (does anyone not like getting packages in the mail?), I sometimes don’t love paying for all those packages. So my goal? Buy really cheap things I love, that still get mailed to me. All the good feelings, none--- less of the guilt. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So recently I bought a pack of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00O71O8XS&quot;&gt;flash tattoos&lt;/a&gt; on Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flash tattoos were everywhere this summer, if you watched basically any bad reality tv. They look amazing on a tan. But. Since I don’t have a tan at any point of the year. There’s no time like the present to hop on the bandwagon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I impulse ordered a set from Amazon. They were 12 dollars for 5 sheets, and were prime eligible. So I got my greedy hands on them super fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/LvL5zMAOFlW0PcvY4Lg9U4rAFppGv87jhGbmXHHGjUs=s873-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bam. All 5 sheets, with extra filters. For those of you who also can’t lay off the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.instagram.com/kay_bueno&quot;&gt;instagram&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My boss actually picked them up out of the mailroom for me, (The first 6 letters of our last names are identical. So his mailbox is next to mine) and asked what they were for. Having no shame, I told my boss (who is a super uncool, but amazing dad type), that they were temporary tattoos for adults. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He laughed at me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I started small for work wear. I went with these guys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-2DBLKelcaYE/VFuxME5kOuI/AAAAAAAANYo/Oi0ULozcrc8/w873-h540-no/IMG_4273.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little ring, and one of the teeny tiny flowers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I won’t show you how to apply these guys, because it’s basically fool proof. Cut out the tattoo, pull off the plastic, stick it wherever, wet, and go. (Actually, for complete honesty. I would do this somewhere you’re hairless. I definitely may or may not have quickly removed some errant knuckle hairs before doing this).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will tell you, full disclosure, that I definitely forgot to take off the plastic the first time I did this. Don’t forget that step. It ruins it. Womp womp. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-36XISQQEM6U/VFuyJbo6W0I/AAAAAAAANZ4/m1mY4kHEw1k/w873-h664-no/IMG_4340.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know you really wanted to see straight up my nose for this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-RT3LIEsHliw/VFuxlpaczJI/AAAAAAAANac/FyYn6YImxtA/w573-h878-no/IMG_4302.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lighting is hard guys. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But! I swear it’s the end of too close for comfort selfies. It’s just really hard to photograph your fourth knuckle if you’re not like, posing for super cute engagement photos or something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Uvaa8UJLt6PcDTYD2No04k3ar8G05jOf0A21LiIX5lU=w873-h1164-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/TA4VeXV12mVV15HV_8u5emgOix_zvMI--jq68z9yo3s=w873-h905-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great. Now that we all can pick my individual body parts out of a line up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They turned out pretty great. No one at work thought they were crazy, in fact, only two girls who stood in line for coffee noticed them. The staying power of the ring has been great. Unfortunately, the little flower-y dude has completely rubbed off. I do a lot of index finger work I guess…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all. I plan on buying more (if they still stay cool) to put alongside whatever else I make at  at Christmas and give to those girlfriends who maybe aren’t your bffs, but still are gift worthy. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, at 5 pages of tattoos, for 12 bucks, in two days. You end up paying less than 20 cents a tattoo. Not bad Kay. Not bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are you splurging (or saving!) on lately?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Because disclaimers are cool. I wasn’t compensated in any way by the random Amazon company I bought these from. In fact, they probably don’t even know I’m alive.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What I ate Wednesday</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you ever wonder what people will think of us in 500 years? I had this exact thought this morning. What would a cultural anthropologist a few hundred years from now think of the fact that every Wednesday, a bunch of people post stylized pictures of what they ate that day? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In spite of the fact that researchers in the future will probably think I’m part of a weird food posting cult, and also judge me for eating packaged eggs. I’m still here to report on the things I ate on my &lt;a href=&quot;http://peasandcrayons.com/&quot;&gt;Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here goes breakfast. Coffee. Kiwi. And the Wilcox bag? That’s two hardboiled eggs. They’re delicious. Judge away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/bzQ_TbxCbziq7eDjXDYVQxKDznYG3LyNeJ90AoZjHqk=w873-h726-no&quot; alt=&quot;Breakfast&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pardon the lunch shot. I’m still not quite comfortable announcing to my coworkers that I’m going to be photographing my food. But I made a grilled veggie and chicken sandwich and paired it with a macaroni and chickpea soup in a vegetable-tomato broth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ZezR8-0q7r_o2tyq6jWolba07qwWW2sDypdqDf87av4=w873-h655-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This apple doesn’t look anywhere to actual scale of an apple. But it was my post lunch snack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work brought around these cups of chia seed pudding. They were unreal. Diced mango, chia seeds, coconut milk, agave, and mint. Delicious. I may or may not try to recreate this it was so good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/R33nSfWkH7PN0zsngTEE6oCGWseqWDatIarqpq7ECuc=s873-no&quot; alt=&quot;Chia pudding&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not dinner yet here. But I’ll probably snack on something at home. I’m not a big late meal person. I tend to sleep better when I eat less at night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s your current snacking fave? I&amp;#39;m looking for something new. All my summer snacks seem &lt;em&gt;so wrong&lt;/em&gt; when we&amp;#39;re approaching winter. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Castle Rock State Park.</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it gets dark at 5 pm, there’s basically no chance for me to get out during daylight. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’ve been daydreaming about what life would be like without daylight savings, and reminiscing to a hike J and I did a few days before the time changed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Castle Rock State Park is one of my favorite places to hike, even though it’s probably better known for it’s rock climbing, bouldering, belaying, rappelling and more. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I love it for the views&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-doBmHF1zScGvwo9FfVpWFeeRgtq2pdaPrc65HetTYY=w1038-h454-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Castle Rock’s trails actually connects to the ones at Big Basin, so you can easily hike for 30+ miles. But J and I traditionally do the Saratoga Gap trail to the Castle Rock camp grounds and then back through the ridge trail past Goat Rock. Which is a really detailed way of saying we hike for 6-7 miles. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saratoga Gap puts you on an exposed ridge where you do a lot of scrambling up and around rocks to keep hiking. It’s probably medium strenuous. Like, we haven’t taken J’s parents, but any of our friends could rock the route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-uYzP2Anu9jg/VDtjmdpnxXI/AAAAAAAALr8/xMeCrGFJ4-c/w955-h716-no/IMG_3838.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorite part is that all the rocks are fair game. You see people like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/WKQ2bdXxrAU-B-1j-jhS3b9om1KncGZu4NJn7lRPBRM=w1038-h685-no&quot; alt=&quot;top of the rock dude rapelling&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or just J and I climbing around on small 15 foot rock formations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-lD1IuOS6uTE/VDtj-2xuBRI/AAAAAAAALvI/D4LssBlYwuc/w955-h716-no/IMG_3855.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to be left out of my own blog, I took a selfie or two during the hike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/6kYbmHltTvkWkTcrLwFhcrUF6fQd-PcIyqxtNkohgMg=w537-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;K mid hike&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;J and I eventually want to backpack here, because it’s one of our favorite South Bay hikes of all time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How’s the time change treating you? Have you still been getting outside?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Halloween Weekend, the ugly and the not so ugly.</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve never been the type of person to have a ton of school spirit, or any type of spirit. I wasn’t the kid who dressed up for football games, or Halloween, or events or conventions. I don’t begrudge those who do, on the contrary. I’m a little jealous. I wish I could put something amazing together for every holiday, and pull it off. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, J’s the same. Except, this year we had a Halloween party that we had to have costumes for. And I found this out… 2 days before. So I threw together a costume of things I had in my house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/prZ9iCOhLt60TCYlLsDZykOuOJoIgOeQT8kFXvuMY7s=w493-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;K costume&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A white t-shirt, brown eyeshadow, lipstick, food coloring and corn syrup came together for a pretty serious zombie. Work loved it, but a few coworkers freaked out. Definitely an ugly costume, and not the traditional sexy one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-mRxBHp7sSlM/VFPI0AcgesI/AAAAAAAAM0o/vbIcGWlQVEI/s716-no/IMG_4167-MIX.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;K panel&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It worked great with J. His hazmat suit (a legit Amazon purchase) and my seriously ill zombie were couples costumes without being like, Peanut Butter and Jelly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/wTNjCJT-fdipjaZbB_r8xjW3yY5PzMfou4rC0Qd8VGY=w598-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;j costume&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But my whole weekend wasn’t spent sitting in sticky corn syrup blood and heavy makeup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a nail appointment with the best salon in San Francisco. Legit, I’ve tried at least 4 different salons with gels. Every single one I had cracking by the third day. And they do gel nail art. Shakira at &lt;a href=&quot;http://sparklesanfrancisco.com/&quot;&gt;Sparkle&lt;/a&gt; is my fave. I seriously shell out for her every single month. That’s how long her nails last. An entire month. (If you don’t mind some grow out!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-JoJlJYYi3fA/VFbUZ_kn3hI/AAAAAAAAM6w/jK3tqKK3tus/s716-no/IMG_4202.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;nails&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only thing as good looking as my nails, was chilling with &lt;a href=&quot;http://almostgettingittogether.com/&quot;&gt;Cassie&lt;/a&gt;. We got the most beautiful beet salads ever at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bluebarngourmet.com/&quot;&gt;Blue Barn&lt;/a&gt;. Seriously. I want to eat this every day of my life now. Forever and always.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/gJN3vD6H38xqIcN9VEz16Q3PJ7RLm131hjrrzOLcU7g=w955-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;salad&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to make it look like my entire Sunday was food, but between coffee and lunch we stopped at the Fort Mason Farmer’s Market. Super adorable. I bought some candied walnuts and walnut butter from a stand by &lt;a href=&quot;http://olddogranch.com/&quot;&gt;Old Dog Ranch&lt;/a&gt;. The candied walnuts were just okay, but the maple walnut butter was out of this world. I got a mini jar, and thank god, because I’m literally like half way through it one day later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/mXL7lgkbuGFTvco6wdyb8bOkVKoig4iGLEJB9goD4b8=w955-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;farmers market&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was the coolest weekend, and I’m only sad I didn’t take more pictures! Now it’s back to work, and writing interview feedback while watching How to Get Away with Murder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, while the start of the week sometimes sucks on the work horizon, I love using it to structure the other five days. I’m hoping to get a bunch of yoga and running in this week. Hold me to it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’re your goals for the week? &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why I’ve been MIA this week</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being off routine is hard. And I’ve been out of whack this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I flew Monday night into Baltimore. Drove to Maryland. Slept for 4 hours, and then woke up to interview a bunch of awesome students. The campus was gorgeous&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/uJv3RlnS1it3oYHYZRGTuHXcscFOxEIGOYvROXTec00=w707-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Oc0_UvKVCM-9A-JmSpENM11UB1EkjU7dkmE9BEQu_Ek=w980-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finally felt like I was experiencing fall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I flew back Wednesday and had a lot of work waiting for me. I’ve basically been holed up at my desk and home until today when I helped with the company Halloween party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/QUkuFwp9oNoOEC8oRpm1-2Cq3_dG5zhct5toSqgO1Jo=w1038-h607-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I’m putting together a last minute zombie costume. (Oh god)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ypQXQHDhJQYLsLtzWVWDVwrOjl0KtjKilkOpygokiQ0=w501-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mixing up some fake blood as we speak. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are your weekend plans? Halloween parties anyone?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Run 10 Feed 10 recap</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spoiler alert. I ran Run 10 Feed 10, and I was bad. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s start from the beginning though. I woke up at 6 am to get ready for this race. I had carefully prepared all the things I needed the night before. However, my morning brain couldn&amp;#39;t remember where I put them. So I spent like half an hour freaking out and looking for them. Good going Kay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I pulled myself together, and hauled myself to Crissy Field. I was pumped. The views were beautiful. There were a ton of runners. It was good. I started snapping some quick pictures from the field of the bridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-JLSTgjLKqvw/VE01Eoh6K5I/AAAAAAAAMdA/4GcCJDtqWNM/w955-h716-no/IMG_4068.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate subtle foreshadowing, so I&amp;#39;m going to be obvious here. The bridge looks pretty high up from where I was taking photos. I thought nothing of that at the time. The morning was beautiful, there were cute booths. I got to put on a temporary tattoo and got prizes for taking selfies (basically my dream). The world was good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/oPjIXWqMXULk-fHw8WGbMWHrYd6C5QZ2BOtZRre4r88=s716-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Women&amp;#39;s Health put on a killer display. There were a bunch of adorable sponsor booths. We warmed up with a very calm instructor from a local yoga studio. They had tons of photographers coming around snapping pictures, making me feel like people should always be taking pictures of my pre-run festivities. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They lined up the runners into different pace groups. I wanted this to be a chill run, and didn&amp;#39;t want to feel super competitive (I did this run to take pictures of the bridge!) So I put myself in the last group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/xb6nh2Ig8Cy7LDBk8DucHLSOfwyxFFLHAYJgAwQ2AcI=w955-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we started! There wasn&amp;#39;t a lot of fanfare for this. I hit the button on my cheapo Garmin, and started my playlist that I haven&amp;#39;t updated since Seawheeze and started running. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The photos of the bridge, are pretty killer. And the road was blocked off, so I didn&amp;#39;t feel overcrowded or anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/g6CTli4YXS60_cK1vMpZad5XyBSXcqSPX6DzwCg5Mis=w955-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-L5PVajP060w/VE01S6Jb9sI/AAAAAAAAMfA/loE2VqAxrW4/w955-h716-no/IMG_4079.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However. This route starts with a whole lot of uphill. Annnd. Elevation and I aren&amp;#39;t friends. Furthermore, if you know how a bridge works, it&amp;#39;s basically sloping up and down the entire way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my recent runs, I haven&amp;#39;t been feeling any fatigue until mile 5 or so. On this run, 2 miles in and I was gross. Sweaty, and breathing heavy, and a real mess. While they had water at the other end of the bridge, there were not enough water stations in the world to fix and hydrate me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finished the race at an embarrassing 10:30 pace. And looked something like this at the end:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-JsWryTDmHFc/VE01ZY_WriI/AAAAAAAAMf8/Ycs-CFV6urs/w537-h716-no/IMG_4090.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could give you the 150 excuses I have for a bad run. But it really boils down to lack of practice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said. Run 10 Feed 10 was beautiful, and amazing. And if you get the chance to run over the Golden Gate Bridge, you should DEFINITELY do it. At the end there was a delicious bagel and fruit spread, dynamic stretching (I waited 30 minutes in line for this and it was worth every second), and a great yoga session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-QHi6BTmArYk/VE01FndeOtI/AAAAAAAAMdI/1wjQ94KrAMY/w955-h716-no/IMG_4069.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please, tell me of your successes this weekend. I went to the Bridge School Benefit after this, and got to feel really good about my fitbit step count all day. So all in all, not bad. :)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>I&#39;m becoming a bag lady</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today was one of those days that started with the water heater not working. Unfortunately, when you’re trying to wash your hair as infrequently as possible (for its own health!) and you’re on day four or five. You have to shower. Needless to say, my day didn’t begin on a great note.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was packet pickup for Run 10 Feed 10, which is a 10k by Women’s Health that crosses the Golden Gate Bridge. I’ve only ever crossed via car, and I love trashy health magazines. So J and I walked to the running store to pick up my packet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/5_WXeAHPHW6KLkHkd8fT4pquxQxePo8tJr32dEPlCtE=w1038-h684-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the fact that it’s November, we scrambled out in tshirts because the weather here is still in the 70s. It’s crazy. Halloween is in a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-aWwc5m7Lyg0/VEwgXHVRWcI/AAAAAAAAMag/I7F_2koYoyI/w931-h716-no/IMG_4055.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Run 10 Feed 10 bag was adorable. But hilariously, I’m most excited for the temporary tattoos. I missed doing the “Run Yoga Party” spray on tattoos for Seawheeze and so I’m making up for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ended up with another free bag for Google Shopping Express (a same day delivery service in the Bay). Their logo is a parachute, and so they sent out these adorable themed bags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-KKPCJfw6hqQ/VEwgMsKkbII/AAAAAAAAMXo/WZ4m3CEu6QI/w537-h716-no/IMG_4049.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reusable bags are a pretty big deal here, since it costs 10 cents to buy disposable bags at any store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we got home we had already walked a bunch around the city. So I snapchatted my family really attractive faces while J worked. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-FNcJqtnk2Lw/VEwgbE_drXI/AAAAAAAAMZU/0jfKn9dQfO4/w537-h716-no/IMG_4058.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve got dinner plans and an early bedtime waiting for me tonight. (Race starts at 7:30ish) Eugggh. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s the best swag you ever got? (I hope it’s not temporary tattoos, otherwise, we gotta talk.)&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No real update today babes. I had one of those days at work where you’re cranking things out so hard that you don’t realize you’ve been there ten hours. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weekend is going to be a straight up blast though. Women’s Health 10k, on Sunday, and Bridge School Benefit too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only adorable part of my day came in the form of lunch. Work was celebrating breast cancer awareness. So they did a beet paper (pink) wrapped sushi roll. With a salad, and some indian inspired cabbage dish, they were a pretty fantastic lunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/WuMLVMW0au8cTH9IOMovY93FnGZ2-xaikS0p_jFumIM=w955-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How was your weekend shaping up? Any major plans?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What’s your motivation?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 5:30 pm, after a 9 hour day of standing (I have a lovely standing desk), looking at a computer screen, and typing, the last thing I want to do is go run, or exercise in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then my brain starts telling me. “Oh, you don’t need to run. You have… work. You’re… tired. You could… spend this time better.” And it takes a lot of work, some will power and a few tricks to get myself here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/3f1JmkMPH6r8vXm5xiiDYymZwE3rDdIYEdxI9f6XLKg=w955-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Seriously this is one of the few times I cared enough in the morning to put on matching socks. Usually I have like, one lime sock and one purple one.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been working on a few tricks to get myself to keep ignoring the lazy person inside of me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;1. Buy myself things for doing exercise&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Childish perhaps. And consumeristic, but very effective. Usually, I set some sort of goal, like: “Exercise 5 days this week”. This week (given I work out tomorrow) I’m buying &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/listing/167820434/day-of-the-dead-boston-terrier-sugar&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-piTRIVkYqxQ/VEm-JxvgxFI/AAAAAAAAMVw/FLjZze7szn0/w570-h544-no/diadelosdog.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;2. Keep everything I need to workout at my desk&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone in my building has a little file cabinet. And while most people keep extra work supplies in them (one of my coworkers keeps his full of listerine), I keep a bunch of shirts, a spare pair of tennis shoes, socks and hairbands in them. So I can always get from work appropriate to workout appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-KEi93M6r840/U-KsUJ8tcrI/AAAAAAAAE2k/H9NScVWwhrc/w537-h716-no/IMG_1863.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Things I wouldn’t mind putting in my file cabinet. If I had more money, and I trekked up the the Nike store more often.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;3. Brag&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one likes the self righteous exerciser. But I have a few key friends who put up with my boasting because they know if I keep up on staying fit, I’m a more sane person. And I’m always open to them when they want to hit me up about their latest sweat sesh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with all of this, sometimes fitness still falls by the wayside. What’s your trick to keeping motivated?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What I ate Wednesday</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have to say, while I usually don’t love looking at my own mediocre pictures of food that I secretly take while (I hope) my coworkers aren’t looking. I get some perverse joy out of seeing what other people are eating, and so in that, I have to indulge you in my Wednesday food lineup. If you too love looking at what others are eating check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://peasandcrayons.com/&quot;&gt;more here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is food no filter. So what I ate, I snapped. Basically, all my meals are provided by my workplace. So I’m a little constrained with what I eat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/TJJMFn1QlUzjpfCuBH3DXkXqBDnOY3uJ0lLhYfVIBFA=w890-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Breakfast is usually fruit + eggs or cottage cheese. (Plus a giant coffee, black). This is just the most simple meal that will tide me over until lunch. I have this basically every day but Friday. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-MfHRSq3-7l4/VEgCW9NYkEI/AAAAAAAAMSE/H7LNXJd4D2A/w955-h716-no/IMG_4034.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a food truck here today that served salads!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-aSb6075UWVw/VEgCeFI6DhI/AAAAAAAAMTA/pe7EZep8nlY/w955-h716-no/IMG_4039.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tuna poke salad with carrots, cucumbers, brown rice and a miso dressing. Super delicious but, way too much rice. My bowl looked like this at the end of lunch:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-52GhPzAC0A4/VEgEF-Cx3pI/AAAAAAAAMUs/7N5S-KdmzGs/w875-h716-no/IMG_4040.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a person who lives off of snacks. So in the afternoon, I had a little of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-pU8tj7pG63c/VEfmprnQHvI/AAAAAAAAMUQ/0ZaKsmMxD3w/w604-h716-no/IMG_4028.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And some of&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/XgrbgZ6rEWWi411MZwXCIOK0VHmQmccHA2lUm-TxMfQ=w537-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not much of a dinner person, so taking one from Oliva Pope, I’ll be having a bowl of popcorn, but no wine. I’d snap a picture, but I haven’t eaten it yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over all, I’d probably like to add some more vegetables to my day, and maybe a little protein. I’m hoping to pick up some Quest bars on the suggestion of a friend, because while my body handles sugar substitutes pretty well, I become a maniac on sugar. Maybe next Wednesday I’ll throw in a real salad. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In true form, I can’t end this post without this awesome and hilariously flattering selfie I took and then applied a million filters to this morning. My toggling with weird image settings game is getting so strong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-UoHEEtxeCSk/VEfmnrmhYlI/AAAAAAAAMU0/tiR8ErMnqQk/w438-h716-no/IMG_4026.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know pumpkin is like the it food of the month. I obviously need to work on my pumpkin game. Have you been indulging in any fall favorites?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How I’m improving for Seawheeze 2015.</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seawheeze 2014 was one of the best experiences of my life. It was my first half marathon. I was able to travel to Vancouver to do a beautiful run. I was so in love with it, I signed up only a month after finishing, just to run it again this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-eLhyEkexHl0/U-KbONyZxWI/AAAAAAAADgI/g644W8tVHFk/s716-no/IMG_1567.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Run selfie&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, it was my first half, and there are a lot of things I’d like to improve on the next time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Run other races. Seawheeze was my first half marathon, but it was also my first real race. I didn’t start running until 14 weeks before the race, and unfortunately, I couldn’t even fit a real, organized 5k in before it. But this year, I’m running a bunch of different races. I figure, it’s good to figure out how the whole race circus works before you run 13 miles of one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/--IGr8r8VJnA/U-Ki8-ohixI/AAAAAAAAEM4/j4mgzjUiJ6k/w640-h617-no/IMG_1591.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Train early. While I’m perversely proud that I went from couch to half marathon in a little under 4 months, I think it’s a pretty crazy goal if you aren’t incredibly devoted. I’m excited to have time to improve upon my runs, not just knock out specific mileage in hopes of hitting 13 of them by a certain date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cross train. The app strongly suggests yoga and cross training alongside the running. As a naive, but busy person. I figured. I’m running a race, I just need the running part. So I skipped all the suggested yoga, and cross training, and just ran. This caused a lot of unnecessary tightness, and pain, and if I was more of an idiot, potential injury.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-S3xLpftBP7M/VEWLBo8yDbI/AAAAAAAAMN4/IZrL6rrVwhk/w403-h715-no/IMG_4018.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Train outdoors more. I love, and will make every argument for treadmill running. I can set a pace, turn off my brain, watch bad reality tv on my phone, and put a giant fan on myself since I sweat more than anyone I know. But! If you’re going to run outside, you might want to do some outside runs. I’m hoping to fit more in, or find someone to run with in the park. (And yes, I do photograph my silly treadmill runs.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-TtsJz_VVYeM/U-KwtL-q_oI/AAAAAAAAMOU/Guj6MM381Fk/w1038-h658-no/IMG_2079.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with my newbie mistakes, signing up to run a half marathon on a whim was one of the best things I could have ever done. I’m just hoping to document my gaffes so I don’t let it happen twice. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any half marathon, or just running tips you learned the hard way?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Art is everywhere! Sunday’s recap</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I read on Friday night that Adobe was unveiling a new mural in our neighborhood at 8 am Saturday morning. However, there was no way I was going to get J up before noon to look at one mural. (Heaviest. Sleeper. Alive.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So on Sunday after brunch we stopped by to get a look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Bfiy7YORjd5YW-u9A0-8N92C92z7vizWVNk9mjAdRs=w874-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal, if I remember correctly, is to spark creative moments for passers by. The artist figures people keep their heads down and ignore their surroundings when they walk, and murals like these make you take notice of your surroundings. People were definitely noticing it when we were there, there was practically a queue waiting to snap photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mural is in a larger “park” area, that often holds fitness classes, has super adorable coffee and juice bars, and is generally a fun place to explore. And so we did!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fitness section had some serious monkey bars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-BnsuXs5clUs/VEQhzThqV-I/AAAAAAAAMJ4/CtTdY8Oukiw/w537-h716-no/IMG_4003.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;J on monkey bars&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;J did them with ease. I tried, but it was a total failure. Since most monkey bars are in parks for kids, I always have the safety net of being able to put my feet down. But these were definitely designed with adults in mind. Both J and I had to seriously hop to grab. On the first bar my sweaty palms slipped right off. One day I’m going to go back with some chalk and more resolve, and try again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last installation was this bucket list inspired piece: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/USoJl9xSababi32xk-ViL0UZf0rWLsDmSzvHcJrhayk=w955-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/bWidfx-XZD_sw9aIhh9D-TmdIP35eMCNYrx72nYF1HY=w940-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I loved some of the answers, like: “Do a barrel roll.” or “Kiss someone I love in the rain” or “Help beat cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s silly, but one of the more frivolous goals I have is to be able to do the splits. I didn’t put it on the board, and I’m not sure that it’s something I need to do before I die. But seeing what everyone else has on their bucket list made me think of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s something you want to do before you die?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Awww, shucks.</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing up in the midwest, I’m not particularly accustomed to seafood outside of fish, and maybe shrimp in a cocktail. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when a good friend was having her birthday at a state park, two hours north of San Francisco, where the plan was to shuck oysters. I was pumped! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And petrified. I’ve never taken a shell off of anything more than a hermit crab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The location was beautiful. To be fair, every beach in California is beautiful, but Point Reyes really has some amazing shoreline views. J and I hiked (if you can call it that) up a short paved cliffside road to watch some surfers and enjoy the view before the other party-goers got there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-rkS27TFvE80/VEMFAEjwjGI/AAAAAAAAMEA/6ZcpuIdQzFk/w955-h716-no/IMG_3942.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-CXTI6SwZFi8/VEMCDr4tu0I/AAAAAAAAMCk/x8hWE1_jy5s/w955-h716-no/IMG_3923.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 20 people came, a pretty good turn out for a seaside birthday. Unfortunately, the most familiarity anyone in the group had with shucking oysters was a few YouTube videos. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, both sea otters and gulls are pretty good at getting oysters open. So we figured a few 20 somethings with knives couldn’t do too poorly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/CcaP5WI4p5HR4fZxtbm5KyT3vd03UIZHy4wDlid00iY=w680-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/VPYqwIhuHBV5a3i4nBkx3eApZWYmaq68Rz1wo2UEkS8=w622-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After success with the first mollusc, everyone wanted to get their hands on one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Tc3Fa-vnu_5UsL8U0VJA1ehdMl6bhPzk4KfFbgCHvrI=w1037-h601-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had 100 oysters, a bunch of sides, and some gorgeous picnic tables laid out by the beach. Turns out, even for a midwestener, getting oysters out of their shells isn’t very difficult, and eating them fresh with a little lemon and hot sauce is one of the best things ever. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/fPGy6Vpys5B7JjxUXCEFc6tucdn4zEmWGCRq990SbUE=w570-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friends, sun, sand and sea were the perfect way to spend a Saturday morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How’s your weekend going? Try anything new recently?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Friday Favessss.</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My mailbox has had a pretty awesome week of packages, and so I wanted to share all the great things I got this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My team at work just launched, and so to celebrate we got t-shirts (and also went out for beers and appetizers.). Usually, shirts from work are the type of thing you only ever want to wear to sleep, or work out in. This one actually looks kind of okay (if you disregard the serious duck face I’m giving. Haha.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7nCyC0pfUJ8/VEG80m0NoCI/AAAAAAAAL-o/FgfKRu6LAYY/w537-h716-no/IMG_3903.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am an addict for subscriptions, and one of the lesser known ones I love is &lt;a href=&quot;http://footcardigan.com/&quot;&gt;Foot Cardigan&lt;/a&gt;. They send you an adorable pair of socks monthly. Both J and I have a subscription, and they’re awesome because, who doesn’t wear socks? Granted, few people see them except when I’ve got my pants cuffed to bike to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This month’s festive pair is so adorable though. ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/nBAuTLZjZ6GfkDFcivjSZCnIpj9KdQEBJL0OOyrkTp8=w955-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I buy waaaaay too many cards. While I keep pretty light on spending usually, I am basically a card hoarder. Fortunately, it comes in handy when you find out you’re going to a birthday with only a few days notice. This one is super adorable and kitschy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-YgTuE4yHgWw/VEHaHV3thKI/AAAAAAAAL_U/bX2TQQ9P_Og/w537-h716-no/IMG_3912.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last, but not least. Shoes! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was in first grade and a student wore new shoes to class, the teacher would let you stand on your desk, and then almost as if singing happy birthday, or saying the pledge, all the other students would say in tandem “Ooooh, ahhhh, neeeew, shoooes.” It was a great way to start a healthy shoe addiction young.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the VivoBarefoot ones. The boyfriend has been super into minimalist traveling, and so he convinced me into trying a pair of barefoot shoes. They’re incredibly light, and only have a 4 mm base, which makes me less of a giant. I’m pretty addicted to my Mizunos, but I’ll be giving these a try this week. It&amp;#39;s definitely a different feel from cushy shoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/i4jcycKLfXM749LaDzSnfDrjzYlq60orF3QfNSb0AEc=w693-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any big plans for the weekend? Got any faves from this week?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Woooah, it&#39;s fall.</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up until today, my life still felt like summer. California has been bright, sunny, and warm. I had yet to bundle up in anything more than a t-shirt. Heck, even the trees were still bright green.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But today, that all changed! Now, it’s unquestionably fall. And it all began with a pumpkin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-zyYtyfJV3M0/VECHHx2RjqI/AAAAAAAAL4o/jKQ34uBCFcE/s716-no/IMG_3896.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 1600 pound pumpkin for that matter. Someone had delivered it to the office, and it was as tall as me (and I’m 5’10”.) And just… giant. All I could think of is how many muffins, scones, and spice lattes you could make with that sucker. Delicious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, at lunch, I got roped into (read: I totally volunteered for) making decorations for my company’s Halloween party. It’s Alice in Wonderland themed (isn’t that the best? Spooky and whimsical without being cliche). So today I helped fold some of 800 paper roses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-e0VbHCYZ4pU/VECHK6cMIyI/AAAAAAAAL7A/h9EWMwH_OWY/w955-h716-no/IMG_3894.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ZF2V5EM3i-8/VECHMOCKi6I/AAAAAAAAL60/68CytVOVMYg/w756-h716-no/IMG_3895.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Folding was a nice break from my typical daily work. The directions were super easy, and surprisingly, despite a bunch of us all working at once, the flowers turned out great. &lt;a href=&quot;http://pldevents.com/how-to-paper-flowers/&quot;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is basically exactly what we did. Everyone at the table kept remarking that it felt like they were crafting for their wedding all over again, and how much they missed the DIY aspect of planning for it. By lunch end, we had knocked out about 100. The Queen’s maze is going to look great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decorating for Halloween and giant pumpkins started getting me in the fall mood. But then I walked into yoga tonight, and the class door was open to the outside, and it was freezing. Finally the temperature was telling me something. It’s fall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-EZoSRD1DDwo/VECHNSPdIFI/AAAAAAAAL6k/43k4kG1bioA/w999-h716-no/IMG_3897.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We closed the door and got to class. This yoga is called “Creative Yoga and Flow”, and it&amp;#39;s the first yoga class I ever took. The first time I took from this instructor, when she was fixing my form, she gasped and cried out (to the entired class) “You need yoga! Your muscles are so tight. You work out too much with no yoga.” While simultaneously flattering (I work out!) and embarrassing (omg did everyone hear that), her class has been great for me to deepen my stretches in the basic poses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-_bgZZCOtseE/VECHQI9fotI/AAAAAAAAL6s/_KwG6uo6btk/w906-h716-no/IMG_3899.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, I’m ready with my mat, block and strap, well before the class starts. I can’t lie, I like to be on time. But my biggest pet peeve, is people who walk in late. 5-10 minutes late? Totally fine. 30-45 minutes late in an hour and fifteen minute class. Ridiculous. By that point, I’m in the middle of class, holding a pose, and the student who just walked in is asking me to move. Totally throws me off. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How’s your day been? Feeling fall? And what’s your biggest pet peeve?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hawaii Day 6 - The end of Hawaii :(</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the Big Island, we stayed in the cutest B&amp;amp;B right outside Volcanoes National Park. Bamboo Orchid Cottage is basically a giant house buried in the middle of (what feels like) the rainforest. The owner is fantastically fun, and takes great care of the place, when we came in after hiking, the fireplace was lit, a soothing CD was on, and the room smelled amazing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But my favorite part was the breakfast:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/tNAA6yV3qOsxM6g69jd01eCI6kOJrwSlnqU3OxhtkZA=w845-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The owner made us all lobster shaped papaya boats! The fruit on Hawaii was so fresh that I could have eaten two of these every morning. So delicious. My other favorite (and one of the only things I bought in Hawaii) was this adorable running shirt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/D5jpeMh3ztJPMks3VI0dszMP2Eng2_wQ101seD9I8lM=w537-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The store was so cute, and when we walked by I had to run in and have it. Had to. I can’t wait to do a race in this sucker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent some time hiking Akaka Falls, hiking is a strong word as it’s just a tiny loop. But unlike in Maui, the falls here had water! It was a beautiful destination, but be warned, they make you pay to enter, even if you don’t park in their lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-9-OrUfrB19o/VB9JRklLUkI/AAAAAAAAJkU/6BGtZ7pmXRw/w537-h716-no/IMG_3665.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;J and I hit up some other scenic points. They were nice, but I was tired, and not feeling so well. Fortunately, J took picture duty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Thf3Fx1KeTs/VB9KAKcFcPI/AAAAAAAAJpI/VrBkFNSz3gw/w955-h716-no/IMG_3691.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/--11jUmZu2b0/VB9J3dcDe7I/AAAAAAAAJoM/6w8b-l1FD4c/w955-h716-no/IMG_3686.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We flew back to Maui, since we were departing from there, and checked into our hotel. I was only feeling worse, so we ordered room service. It was my first room service ever. I took a picture, even if I didn’t really eat any of it. :/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-L0gQwEkZRFk/VB9KHcqc6RI/AAAAAAAAL4A/nfZ3Xn7Tf5c/w955-h716-no/IMG_3696.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still feeling ill the next morning, I sent J out to our snorkel reservation. I was bummed I missed it, but his pictures are too amazing not to post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-C5ZA5-W-bGg/VB-pn-hEewI/AAAAAAAALbU/-Kc0N2h_T-A/w1038-h688-no/turtle-head.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Fflw0h7Hgv0/VB9voVeuy2I/AAAAAAAAJ0k/C_sPgLY_Scg/w1038-h688-no/turtlejon.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We flew home that evening. It was an amazing trip, and we really got to enjoy good weather, and no internet connection (a lovely break from the all the time internet connection we have). J and I definitely hope to go back seeing as we’re closer to Hawaii than NYC now. :)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hawaii Day 5 - Volcanoes!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a few days in Maui, we decided to hop on over to the Big Island. While there were lava reports on the radio, we didn’t see any active lava. We didn’t think it would be in good spirits to tour on someone else’s devastation. So instead we spent a lot of time at Volcanoes National Park exploring previous eruption sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-FI4O0ZC6V_0/VB9vWUX-wHI/AAAAAAAAJyo/IRAWmfKDdoY/w1038-h692-no/IMG_1168.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We woke up early the morning after our flight to head over to the park. We wanted to start the day by stretching our legs, so, we hiked the Kīlauea Iki Trail to the Thurston lava tube. It’s a 6 mile hike into what was once a lake of lava. Having since dried out, the crater is a great place to explore volcanic scenery. Getting there early led to much more amazing pictures. By 10 am, tons of tourist buses had offloaded, filling the crater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/8qeoFChDldhfzPzB3fzGqYFORHe0C4at18xwqGRa77U=w524-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We learned a lot about what happens after a volcanic eruption, and getting to see the rocks and crags up close was great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-WYWjWGiFGro/VB9vgECbLEI/AAAAAAAAJzI/rXAawJudE-M/w477-h716-no/IMG_1195.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;J was really into the learning aspect of the crater, and I was really into the making fun of J for learning so much about a crater aspect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_sLeHtxIGEim-Vqw5G2xjIk1T1Zn36EIWOOrocTl40Q=w581-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though it’s a kind of random picture, a few days before, I had caught a surfboard with my arm while surfing, and had developed a pretty serious bruise. I wanted to preserve it with a photo. Better my arm than my face, I guess. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/P6oRx7G0ZmDhOs2utVWKvX-H9khU3RxxzumJRHE1wN4=w979-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We scaled out of the crater and into the lava tube, where bus, upon tour bus was parked. The tube is a great in and out jaunt, but it didn’t really offer much when compared to the crater. And the pictures inside made my inner photographer cry. With all the flash, poor lighting, and people everywhere, it didn’t lead to great pictures, or a great experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Zc_vJJbFJ7E/VB8vV6SO6tI/AAAAAAAAJOA/ro2vLORrjSE/w955-h716-no/IMG_3524.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After, we drove the chain of craters road. The views were awesome, but the road was more hyped that we’d have liked. It’s a 20-30 mile road that stops where a lava flow crossed the road in 2003, blocking the path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Gm7oRBZz8Z0/VB9vml2pFNI/AAAAAAAAJ0E/wfQUPLYJOEE/w1038-h692-no/IMG_1219.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, we saw our first real lava sighting. We drove to the Jaggar Musuem to watch the lava out of the Halema&amp;#39;uma&amp;#39;u Crater. It was a really beautiful experience. We got in right before sundown, and stayed until sunset. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-bq7B-XPq2sA/VB-UmRfImzI/AAAAAAAALR0/HUnRO8WOK0Q/w808-h538-no/IMG_1119-MOTION.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hawaii Day 4 - Pipiwai Trail!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ughhh. I’ve been sick this entire weekend, and looking at pictures of me hiking and healthy in Hawaii was just too much to handle. But I wanted to get the rest of the trip up on the blog before I lose any more momentum and just start blogging cute exercise clothes I want to buy or something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;J and I were last in Hana. Having completed the infamous Road to Hana trip. It was our first (and only) night on the east side of the island. So we wanted to catch sunrise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-FSauXjXzYew/VB-ojuZn_SI/AAAAAAAALVg/PBok97Nk0HM/w1062-h708-no/IMG_0770.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, it was worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting up for sunrise made it easy for us to grab an early start. After the sun came up, we headed out to the Oheo Gulch, aka the Seven Sacred Pools. It’s technically an extension of Haleakala National Park, although it only has two trails. The trail down to the pools, and the Pipiwai trail. We did both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-0Dr3qSBlCjY/VB-o5uw9KHI/AAAAAAAALXU/mlyxhqwko60/w1062-h708-no/IMG_0950.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trek down to the pools is short, sweet, and passes by that giant tree you see above. Unfortunately, during our trip, the pools were pretty dry, with only one, maybe two to swim in. If you don’t bring your suit (we didn’t) there’s not a whole lot to see at the pools. It’s a great place to float, relax, and grab a nice tan, but not much else. You can see the swimmers behind Jon’s head in this snap at the pools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-CDezCLEVcLY/VB-o-DtnmxI/AAAAAAAALXo/gfPzABdMwI8/w1062-h708-no/IMG_0998.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we headed to the Pipiwai trail. This is one of those hikes that really makes you wait for the good parts. It was 80 or 90 degrees, humid, and most of the waterfalls along the way were pretty dry. Out of need for shade (and a break from walking on an exposed trail uphill) we stopped to climb a tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-mLGFEyfU9lM/VB-pFHBlbSI/AAAAAAAALYQ/ReaYECKIg74/w477-h716-no/IMG_1020.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a mile and a half in or so (doesn’t sound like much until your ass is sweating, hiking up hill, with no shade). You reach the bamboo forest. When I read about this before going, I was kind of underwhelmed. Like “Woo hoo, what’s so cool about a bunch of bamboo?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AN6al0HCxBU/VB-pJqZY2CI/AAAAAAAALYk/GYgBh4tlqIQ/w477-h716-no/IMG_1025.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll tell you what! Bamboo sounds like deep, hollow, wind chimes whenever a breeze rolls through. Add that to the fact that our path was shaded, and J and I thought it was the greatest thing ever. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It felt pretty surreal to walk through the bamboo though, it’s just not a plant or experience we ever get at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-N5e9UihtbT0/VB-pJ0C3HvI/AAAAAAAALYo/wX2JecS77pc/w1062-h708-no/IMG_1029.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After what seems like a lot of bamboo. You hit the end! Which is this beautiful waterfall. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-zWSDob6NLq4/VB-pLv1NOJI/AAAAAAAALYw/_bil7P3IRLo/w1062-h708-no/IMG_1035.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sign we’re standing in front of said to not cross it, or fear getting swept away and dying. However, the current ahead was nothing more than a trickle, so we (and basically the other 20 people who hiked there) went past the sign. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7IK926oKYFM/VB-pRNkY7vI/AAAAAAAALZM/mqR1kXn5D6c/w477-h716-no/IMG_1050.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s the entire falls (with J at the bottom for scale). It was huge, and beautiful. But very very slim. A lot of the falls were almost dry when we visited. And like the pools at it’s base, there were groups of people who came to the falls to swim. So, word to the wise, in Maui, basically, always wear a suit. Or, always be swimming… Or something&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hiked back to the car. Left Hana, and got lunch. We stopped at the Naihiku market and J got the most amazing fried ahi tuna ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-pg45aJCrsgg/VB8mfREAfeI/AAAAAAAALgU/TfEffExsFVA/w884-h716-no/IMG_3325.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t look like much, but the fish was fresh caught, and fried in front of us, and was probably, no joke, the best food we had on Maui. The passion fruit, aka lilikoi, aka get in my stomach best fruit ever, was good too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We finished our drive, took some pictures of the scenery (which is beautiful, even if J doesn’t look enthused in the photo below) and went back for a relaxing evening in Wailea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-_HnKkUignm4/VB-pN4YWaOI/AAAAAAAALY4/K_S5ZM3u3fQ/w1062-h708-no/IMG_1058.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hawaii Day 3 - Road to Hana!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Road to Hana! Road to Hana! Road to Hana! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to say it’s name too many times, but Road to Hana is one of my favorite parts about Maui. It’s a great reason to get a jeep, take the top off, and drive a few hours down a long windy road that goes to nowhere. (And buy, and consume a lot of banana bread along the way!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-s5Kco6FBw5E/VB-oufZyDPI/AAAAAAAALWo/1sIPJvAu2SA/w1062-h708-no/IMG_0856.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So of course, J and I rented a Jeep (after a lot of begging on my part for a Jeep) and set out early on day 3 to embark on the Road to Hana. It’s a drive that could be done back and forth in one day, but J and I wanted to hike a bunch along the way, and do the Pipiwai trail at the Oheo Gulch. So we decided to spend a night in Hana. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was almost disastrous, as we planned this trip to Hawaii just the week before we flew here. And little did we know, the original day we planned to do Road to Hana, there was a huge foot race/relay on the route. (We’re talking thousands of people running on a one lane road) Thankfully, when we tried to book a hotel, the receptionist told us we were choosing the worst dates for this. Phew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/NDWzD7LDKbOi2GbZdMLKyZHHkiFU53FG0DhuS5v_ZmQ=w489-h715-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Road to Hana is a journey, filled with twisty passes and one laned bridges, and J and I didn’t want to go it alone. So we downloaded the Road to Hana GyPSy app on our phones. Though the narrator is a little cheesy, without him, we would have never stumbled across things like rainbow eucalyptus!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-_ILasbMsR7E/VB-omN9PjoI/AAAAAAAALV4/wa5ecKZL-3c/w477-h716-no/IMG_0804.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-f6Goa6m-3J0/VB-olMsqzqI/AAAAAAAALV0/uOIYvt1i88A/w477-h716-no/IMG_0796.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which are, in my mind, the prettiest trees I’ve ever seen. (Take that cherry blossoms). We also ended up in Keanae. A quiet town with pretty black rock beaches. One of the great things about this narrated, GPS based tour, is that the narrator gives you five important things to do on the road. So there’s no analysis paralysis of trying to pick the best places to stop along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-EPNa5-3laKc/VB91UcXnVnI/AAAAAAAAKXw/cWRt7PIRZow/w1062-h708-no/IMG_0823.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the road, we stopped in Hana. We found a super cute hotel called the Hana Kai Maui (of no relation to the Mana Kai Maui). It was seriously one of the most, clean, modern places we stayed. It felt beachy without having that fake resort feel. And the kitchen was high tech. I wanted to live there forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-EDQooL44HU0/VB92YQvF9dI/AAAAAAAAKeA/mzgYupFIDrU/w1062-h708-no/IMG_0873.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we were on the east side of the island, I hopped into bed as early as possible so I could wake up and catch the sunrise the next day at 5:30 am. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s the last adventure you took?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hawaii Vacation Day 2 - Bike Haleakala</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the second day in Hawaii we were up bright and early to do a 23 mile long bike ride down Haleakala, Maui’s volcano. We booked with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bikemaui.com/&quot;&gt;Haleakala Bike Co&lt;/a&gt; who I would wholeheartedly recommend. Our trip included a van ride to the top, a tour around the crater, and then a long, unsupervised bike ride down. Did I mention unsupervised? (Read: J and I get bored following big groups)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our guide Kemo, was a local who had ridden down the volcano’s roads by bike, skateboard, and even shopping cart. He was hilarious and personable (as every guide should be), and he should basically quit his day job because the man took the most amazing pictures of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-YLpt07JEWDc/VB-ogI31ggI/AAAAAAAALVU/UYlXgTuC0Mk/w1062-h708-no/IMG_0711.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We reached the summit (by van, although there were people people biking up the mountain. My legs ached for them) and were able to get out and explore. Kemo took pictures of all the bikers under the sign, and also against the crater view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Q7dGrbZR34g/VB-odGoPSaI/AAAAAAAALU4/kVjHq8xsJuw/w1062-h708-no/IMG_0697.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was nice to stretch our legs, and the tour wasn’t rushed at all. There were a bunch of people starting hikes into the crater, so much so that J and I considered returning to hike in the crater but we never ended up doing so. :(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-vUqCljSsNTY/VB-ogFnFNKI/AAAAAAAALVM/dmZq7yQr17U/w1062-h708-no/IMG_0719.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Post crater tour, we headed back to where we’d hop on the bikes. You can’t bike down from the crater’s summit, because too many people have died doing it, or liability, or something. So we started a few less-steep miles down the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kemo kept shouting to the back of the van that we were lucky, that days rarely got this clear in Maui. So J &amp;amp; I took about half a million pictures of the landscape. From the higher points on Haleakala, you could see both sides of Maui.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-BKfNwXv49lU/VBbeVvmFWlI/AAAAAAAAIXg/J4PHOk860rQ/w955-h716-no/IMG_3145.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bike ride was amazing, but simultaneously a little frightening. Some parts of the route are twisty, steep, and have cars driving right alongside you. The brakes on the bike are incredibly sensitive, and very strong, which can lead to unintentional whiplash, but save you from a more awful fate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people were pretty inexperienced at biking, but all turned out fine. Honestly, we did watch one of the other members of our group topple over her bike. A mix of nerves, a large tour bus driving alongside her, and a hairpin turn caused it. She was a little scratched up, but mostly embarrassed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-AzTYoF7PNuw/VB9ztNjylJI/AAAAAAAAKNg/IMPtZoO-4VI/w1062-h708-no/IMG_0738.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the ride was super chill. (this is definitely not a calorie burner) But since we spent a few hours out in the sun, we came back tired and chilled the whole evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-pyq7d7jtB48/VB9zjjf67BI/AAAAAAAAKMU/_P-cs2hSHIc/w1062-h708-no/IMG_0730.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s the longest you&amp;#39;ve biked?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hawaii Vacation Day 1 - We arrive in Maui</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve taken a peek at my Instagram. You may have noticed I was in Hawaii last week! Normally, my boyfriend and I are connected to our laptops all day, every day for work. We wanted to get away from the bright screens, and so we took a laptop-free vacation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;J and I left bright and early in the morning, I was super excited and overly awake on the plane while J fell asleep the moment we hit the seats. Fortunately, we scored some great exit row seats so I was able stretch my legs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/643vSB_GhE9l9C7UJzRK2UDbTw3a-WSxEoEKFIrLSpg=w667-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The minute the plane landed, we went to grab a bite to eat. We stopped at Da Kitchen to pick up some local cuisine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bi4cp5quugepcfO5j9NJsKi54VOQfTtzjLFdUAwwoOQ=w587-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite my smile, turns out traditional Hawaiian food isn’t really our thing. I got a pork sandwich, and J ordered a giant Loco Moco (not knowing what a loco moco was, and not knowing that he was ordering the biggest one on the menu). Da Kitchen did a great job cooking our meal, but it was a little too much, and too greasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To pay for our food sins we decided to start the afternoon off hiking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-fmMhRvAEhP4/VB-pmA6CsSI/AAAAAAAALbk/BRcUUpVNCAM/w1062-h708-no/bestofwaiheejon.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hit the Waihee Ridge trail up around 1pm. Despite everything on the internet telling us this hike would only be good in the morning, or that finding the parking and trailhead was difficult, we had no problem with either. Google Maps saved the day once again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/3GxWU7p8FWWH9p38yPUtsupnU9ZK6ZQ9-KR-dZDmJ78=w496-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ridge trail is basically all uphill, and has a bunch of really beautiful lookout points. Every time I thought we couldn’t gain more altitude, we did! It switches between forested and exposed, and is definitely on the challenging side of trails. J and I loved it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-VaD2BzeHpAg/VB-oUxW8ZeI/AAAAAAAALUA/d5-22uGLMwg/w1062-h708-no/IMG_0578.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the serious climb, the views are totally worth it, you feel like you’re in the middle of a Jurassic Park set. The clouds, waterfalls, and super lush foliage are unlike anything in Northern California. The only thing I’d change? J and I only brought one water bottle for the both of us. We definitely needed two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-8REPgwSmKTU/VB-oZbsPnYI/AAAAAAAALUg/21BC88kBKAI/w1062-h708-no/IMG_0654.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ended the day at the Mana Kai Maui in Kihei. Due to a little switch up with our room, we ended up upgraded into one of their condos. The condo was totally adequate, nothing to write home about. But the balcony, or lanai as all of Maui (and possibly Hawaii seems to call it), was amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-igiayIil4to/VB9yiRsMDBI/AAAAAAAAKF0/NcEN12L-ihw/w1062-h708-no/IMG_0678.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that view, we spent a lot of time on the balcony watching the sunset, the surf, and just chilling. Since the condo came with a kitchen we were sure to grab fruit at the local market. I seriously improved my pineapple cutting skills. I’m a real fruit ninja now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/74r5CwLOW4-ZWpZckwLXx-mp2OYqSQakj5hFjF7dKDM=w1062-h713-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we’re home now! I’ll do some entries over the next few days about the rest of our trip. While vacation is nice, I’m excited to be back into routine. Soylent, running, yoga and work.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Upcoming Races.</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think all I’ve been doing lately is working, sleeping, and signing up for races.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons I keep signing up, is to keep myself running. So I want to pad out my races to approximately one a month. I&amp;#39;m almost covered until the end of the year. But it&amp;#39;s a little spotty in some places. I like doing races that (generally) don&amp;#39;t require fundraising, don&amp;#39;t have colors thrown at you, or zombies, or photoshoots, aren&amp;#39;t super religious, and are relatively fun. With that said, here’s what I’ve got so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-YpDOnJqE-Fk/VBPgFDi14yI/AAAAAAAAIMA/FtNav66dzZ8/w650-h350-no/Screen%2BShot%2B2014-09-12%2Bat%2B11.04.49%2Bpm.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://run10feed10.com&quot;&gt;Run 10 Feed 10 - October 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A philanthropic 10k put on by Women’s Health. I’m super excited because I’ll get to run over the Golden Gate Bridge. (I’ve only ever driven under it. Ooops)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-mAseAeTd5H8/VBPgFNSDXII/AAAAAAAAIMI/vfH8SS9S7wA/w650-h580-no/Screen%2BShot%2B2014-09-12%2Bat%2B11.05.21%2Bpm.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://theuglysweaterrun.com&quot;&gt;Ugly Sweater 5k - November 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My family’s celebrating Thanksgiving with the ugliest 5k of all. I’m super pumped for this 5k. Both to run alongside (and beat) my siblings. But also because I’ve put together the most hideous Christmas apparel of all time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ABozaaNUJpw/VBPfI5BY7gI/AAAAAAAAILM/kkfAvpWU7OU/w679-h177-no/Screen%2BShot%2B2014-09-12%2Bat%2B11.06.01%2Bpm.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;//www.hotchocolate15k.com&quot;&gt;Hot Chocolate 15k - January 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I chose this race because a 15k is like the lazy man’s half. And I’m lazy. And it’s super flat. And there’s chocolate at the end of it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-PLYtiwGpx90/VBPfJf2VfcI/AAAAAAAAILQ/welfgHWRpFk/w711-h350-no/Screen%2BShot%2B2014-09-12%2Bat%2B11.06.51%2Bpm.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.seawheeze.com/&quot;&gt;SeaWheeze Half - August 15, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I got tickets! A race I love so much, I signed up a year in advance. This was literally one of my best experiences this year. It sold out in under a half hour, but both my mom and I managed to sign up.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Soylent so far.</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things have been a little crazy here. Most notably this morning I signed both my mom and myself up for SeaWheeze 2015! Woo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was super excited for it this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/4WtimBfywF1VYbcARzGbXxdfiaif8Z0co0A3F0704Qk=w894-h205-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to recap my experience with Soylent so far. And hit up what I’ve loved, and what I’ve strugged with. Let me give you a week by week of how it’s been.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Week 1&lt;/strong&gt; - Stayed on Soylent all 5 week days. 1200 calories a day on Soylent, uncounted otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Week 2&lt;/strong&gt; - Horrible stressful week with only 1 day Soylent. Let’s not even talk about my eating habits. (I may or may not have gorged myself on a back of mallowcreme pumpkins.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Week 3&lt;/strong&gt; - 2 days Soylent, 500 calories. 5 days muggle food with general moderation.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ZU9U9bjti_M/U-zkJH1cDUI/AAAAAAAAIEI/DCMplJYmIRw/w429-h416-no/IMG_2756.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what’s going on in my blender?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Good:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
1) I’m recognizing that I have a super weird relationship with food. So when I’m drinking Soylent, it’s helping me get away from some of that. For example, when drinking an adequate amount of Soylent to the point where I’m not hungry. I get this feeling like “I deserve a snack.” Even though I am perfectly satisfied, I’m finding I reward myself with food, even though I didn’t do anything award worthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Soylent, when drinking it, is not unpleasant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) I get a lot more done on days with Soylent. I usually take a brief walk at lunch, clear my head. Finish work earlier, and have more time for activities in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) When I drink soylent, I actively want less food days I’m not drinking soylent.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Not-So-Good:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
1) I feel like a jerk turning my team down for lunch daily, or not being able to meet up with a friend after work. I’m not ready to “out” my Soylent habits yet, so a 5 day spread wasn’t working for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Even though Soylent tastes great. I hate the way it smells, makes my house smell, makes me smell. It actively makes me not want to drink it, even though the taste, and general experience is great. I have this mental block before I take the first sip, where I think. Shit, this is going to be horrible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) Since meals are provided for me at work, this is actually more effort than not doing Soylent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-uan3B8_4bp4/VAU1KjXdEkI/AAAAAAAAID4/FsGt0Lpv8Vs/w963-h716-no/IMG_3009.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The food I&amp;#39;ve been wanting to eat with coworkers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So as you can see from my little week break down. I’m shaking it up and doing a 5:2 split. (5 days off, two days on). Which I may move up to a 4:3 split once I get back from vacationing in Hawaii next week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the most important thing is to find a sustainable way to incorporate this into my life. Honestly, the 5 days on spread, it wasn’t fitting my lifestyle. So I’m trying a method that mimics intermittent fasting more. I’ve liked it (so far) more than fasting, because Soylent even at low calories, takes away any hunger or cravings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s been working for you so far?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Cleaning out my closet.</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting things done over this long weekend. My closet has been the ultimate mess since I moved in. I bought these cheap wire storage bins to store clothes. Spoiler alert, they didn&amp;#39;t work. So I spent today re-doing my closet/dressing area. First order of business, get a real dresser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to Ikea, even though every time I build a piece of their furniture I promise myself I will never ever go Ikea again. But then they&amp;#39;re so cheap and easy that I forget the building hell, and I keep coming back. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-g8mbbk9_2XQ/VAPVRIDirUI/AAAAAAAAH9k/GM_4Gdd_rRE/w896-h672-no/http---makeagif.com--media-8-31-2014-8JH_Pl.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Final product. I still need to hang some things for more color!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/6xr0VUll_dZSV4rIKJX7S-gR6WTKYaDA-GQ6bnDXp2I=w561-h672-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have any fall cleaning planned?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Seawheeze Weekend - Race Recap!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking back at SeaWheeze, my only wish is that I would have taken more pictures. Because, the more I think about it, the more I realize, everything we did there was beautiful. Our B&amp;amp;B (O Canada House) was this amazingly cute Victorian, with fancy plated breakfast, yummy pastries, cute puppies, and the sweetest owner. The weather was perfect all 3 days, the scenery was gorgeous. Really, you couldn&amp;#39;t have asked for a better weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I&amp;#39;m not perfect, so I mostly gawked at everything around me, and didn&amp;#39;t snap near enough photos. After my mom and I hit up the Showcase Store, we went to pick up my race package. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/K0COu1cmh3Hs31a86jn8F_fWN80FTY_1Fa_J_6N3dhM=w668-h672-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talk about no line, we waited maybe 5 minutes to get to a booth and grab the goods. My favorite part of the pack? The Chip Wilson race chip. And the water bottle that we got as swag. I was pretty tired from the early morning, so after getting everything we went back to the B&amp;amp;B, grabbed breakfast, napped, and walked back to the convention center to check out (but not participate in) yoga.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/XTH938gCtrZco3VsTXWPxJyCFGAdV6fDU4WL9MfM3_I=w875-h672-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was surreal to watch a few hundred people doing yoga in the open air. As much as I wanted to join, I&amp;#39;m kind of glad I didn&amp;#39;t. I am out of yoga practice and would have been sore the next day. Which I&amp;#39;ve heard isn&amp;#39;t good when you&amp;#39;re running a half marathon. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of. The next morning, I woke up at 4:30 (again...) to get in line for the half. Since it was my longest run ever, I was incredibly incredibly nervous about doing things right. I was nervous about eating at all before the race, and ended up just having a piece of pumpkin bread before heading over to the convention center. I took a picture in front of the brunch sign before running, so I&amp;#39;m pretty sure I didn&amp;#39;t deserve anything yet. (But at least I looked good at this point.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-piiEleVflbs/VAFfqPTSJ0I/AAAAAAAAHys/hNLWjrrhgwE/w446-h621-no/seawheeze3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were led through a really rousing warm up of jumping jacks and other light exercise. Unfortunately, the warm up was at least 50 minutes before my wave (1:10) made it to the starting line. So I&amp;#39;m not sure it helped much other than to get me in the spirit of the run. It was super easy to find the pace beavers, and they pumped us up, and gave the whole wave tattoos to help track our times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-vzR8vdAkztU/U_jP9OilNcI/AAAAAAAAHiQ/-UDU7R2l-oo/w537-h716-no/IMG_2893.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I&amp;#39;m bad at kilometers, so this wasn&amp;#39;t very useful. But it did stay on, despite all the sweating. I was able to keep pace with the group until about mile 6. Where I started to falter. And by mile 9, I was ka-put. I was a little bummed, but since I had kind of slacked on my long runs right before the race, it&amp;#39;s really what I should have expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the race was a lot of first timers half marathoners, so I wasn&amp;#39;t the only one who got tired around this point. The worst part of faltering early was that the last few miles of the race are gorgeous. Runners are weaving around Stanley Park. But at this point all I was focused on was FINISH THE RACE and DON&amp;#39;T DIE. So I hardly paid attention. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mom was the best cheerleader though! She caught me at 3 of the cheering stations. Unfortunately photographing runners is both hard, and super unflattering. So here&amp;#39;s an okay looking back-shot of me and quite a few other runners going around the water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-LWw4Cc_78u4/VAFfp5BMnFI/AAAAAAAAHzA/RiCrw690Prs/w446-h639-no/seawheeze-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But! I did finish, without medic nor dying. And coming in at 2:29 means that I&amp;#39;ll definitely PR SeaWheeze 2015!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Seawheeze Showcase Store Recap</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the lack of updates. Between Seawheeze, and coming back to a lot of work. I haven&amp;#39;t really had time to update. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seawheeze was amazing, I loved every minute of it. But I can&amp;#39;t lie, the reason I originally signed up for the half, was to get a crack at the showcase store. You see, Lululemon puts out a bunch of limited edition merchandise for the race, and getting one of a kind yoga pants was basically my dream come true. But, honestly, I felt kind of guilty just flying out for new clothes. So I signed up, and trained (a little less than I should have) for a half marathon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my re-telling of the showcase store. Fair warning, this is pretty much the reason I decided to run this race, so I have some serious bias.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mom also came out for the weekend to cheer me on, and she&amp;#39;s pretty much down for everything, so when I told her about the store, she was all set to wake up at 4:30 am and head over. It was an early morning, but we got into a very nice corralled line at 4:45 am. At this point there was still a lot of space, approximately 40-50 people in line total, with chairs and blankets everywhere. We brought a blanket, spread out, chatted with people next to us, and chilled until 6 am. Despite it still being dark out, everyone was amazingly friendly, and I met so many great people. It made me feel less like a crazy person knowing others were up at 4 am too. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/RDyOwbhlZ50QcI2Y5Qd9L151ymaq_Rfl2Prn70ujffk=w608-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to say, getting there right before 5 was clutch, because at 5:00 am, the line started to really heat up. The whole queue probably doubled to about 100, if not 150 people by 5 or 5:15. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At around 6:30, the line was all the way around the convention center. (I know because I had to pee. My suggestion, hop into the Fairmont hotel near by. Almost all the guests are runners, and honestly, we all looked alike.) But when I came back Lululemon had hired had all these cute characters, who were walking around, chatting with the line. Sorry for the potato quality of my photos, my iphone and lack of sleep combined didn&amp;#39;t help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/iP6kUEs-mbVbcu9oQRLk-GomOZDyQC9TgDr6yv4fIS8=w406-h715-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While waiting, my mom and I heard horror stories from other people in line about how in previous years, there was no limit, so the goal was to grab everything in your size. So originally, we planned to divide and conquer, just grabbing everything we could find in both sizes. The doors started opening at 7 am. And they had a volunteer/worker at the door clicking down the amount of people they let in each wave. Fortunately, we were the first group in, and everything was set up beautifully. Each area had little balloons marking the size of that area. So we abandoned our grab each other everything, ran to our respective sizes, and started grabbing stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/KzA9FhUij5IV_m1SJuJ6jtGfpbHUhP46BjMp5NMuYQE=w1056-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My suggestions here. Take everything you think you might want. Duffel bags went within the first group. Know your sizes, because it can be hard to grab product after people have ravaged it. But ultimately, have fun. This felt like the best shopping spree ever. I was like a little kid in a candy store. After we grabbed all the things we wanted, we heaped them down in a pile and started sorting our top 15. We came to our choices pretty quickly. Tried a few things on for size (mostly scuba hoodies and coats) and checked out. The process was easy, flawless, and we were on our way in about 20 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/soXta8Wjm7PgZDYlEza3FBl5cVVcae6OsSVau40Jo7o=w955-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/B_hHhpBgXZgF-9VZxYT1Ic3_zuzcREad0uzClTW3U8U=w955-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later that afternoon, I talked to some girls at the wonderful B&amp;amp;B we stayed at. They arrived to the store after a run at around 7, and waited in line for over 2 hours, and a lot of stuff was sold out. While they thought our morning sounded crazy, personally, as an early riser, waking up two hours earlier than them, and waiting for the same amount of time, seemed worth the amazing stuff we got. Overall my haul looked like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/f3_Deex7zhgaTtTjDfYiiacITZ_Rk30nceJnLdPY3Ro=w955-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really focused on the rainbow swirled pattern, and the graphic dark lines for the pants. I plan on taking some more individual images of different pieces later this week. The showcase store was an amazing experience, and was coordinated so well. It was a great way to meet other runners, and a really exciting start to the weekend. My mom and I both maxed out our 15 pieces, and I&amp;#39;ve really loved the stuff I got. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Race recap soon!&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spending the weekend at the Lululemon Seawheeze half marathon. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be back soon with updates!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Knitting night</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m learning to knit, and projects like this always inititally frustrate me because I&amp;#39;m not perfect at them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now, I look at my running, or biking. When I started those, I was so slow, and so awkward. Lately though, I&amp;#39;m fast, and I feel good when I do it. So I try to remember that the same thing is true of everything I do in life. I&amp;#39;ll be bad at first, and then eventually, and very very slowly, improve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My starter scarf.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>First Weekend Down!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I survived an incredibly busy crazy weekend off Soylent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To try to maintain some social life, I’m not drinking soylent from Friday night to Sunday night. It allows me to still indulge in regular food, crazy activities, and life without a blender bottle strapped to myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most adorable things I ate this weekend:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-1BMoGda3Bt8/U_F4jUYsskI/AAAAAAAAHVc/znTwOUaT5xw/w643-h716-no/IMG_2822.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In more exciting news! J’s coworker got married this weekend, which called for a lot of celebrating. The wedding was north of the city in San Rafael, aka Sun Rafael because it’s soooo much warmer. The ceremony was a balmy 90 degrees, but the reception cooled down to a sweet 70. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crossing the bridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-YqOT7uD9EE0/U_F4JLABPcI/AAAAAAAAHVk/lxuzv6mGO6M/w724-h716-no/IMG_2798.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting dolled up for the wedding&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bxyFfctvb8984eW_zgHGV7hZ0UOtxakyD2DSx71K1G4=w517-h715-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The oak the ceremony was held under. The theme? Love grows here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-E697lsRoop8/U_F4PWaJO8I/AAAAAAAAHVs/WCikAEsF7JA/w654-h716-no/IMG_2801.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorite amped up image of the couple&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/4Ho_Pf_wxE3D_EnDXuh8QDLGgrlUygCNp6b61tuwZ2k=w583-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, this weekend, Soylent taught me how much extra I’ve been eating. I felt more uneasy eating full meals, and I’ve been noticing the heaviness of certain ingredients (sugar, sugar, sugar). My stomach gets upset when it gets to a level I would have considered full just a week ago. And I find myself taking slower, smaller bites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the bright side, spending a week on soylent makes everything taste more flavorful. Spices are hotter and more complex. Cuts of meat seem much juicier. Produce is almost unreal after four days of an unarguably bland liquid. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve had mixed feelings about returning to my Soylent only diet tomorrow. Part of me is incredibly excited not to have to think about food. It complicates my life a lot. But another piece of me is sad to give up on all the flavors, tastes, and overindulgences I’ve had this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve definitely seen a trend down in my weight over the days I’ve had Soylent, which is unsurprising and also wonderful. I’m hoping this mix of soylent and “normal” food will continue to work for me.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The good old wall pantry.</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I live in a teeny tiny apartment, my kitchen is probably the size of a lot of people’s closets. And as such, there are only a few small cabinets for storage. So when you receive 40 pounds of food at once, you have to, as Tim Gunn would say, make it work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This wall has become my make shift pantry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-SxnftEyBGXY/U-zkSJ4PMrI/AAAAAAAAHLs/_-aN1l9n0NE/s716-no/IMG_2763.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Soylent Wall&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had no idea what to expect size wise with soylent. And so, I shipped soylent to myself at work, (it would have gotten nicked from my door), not realizing that each week is about 10 pounds. So I’m delivered this pallet of soylent that I have to haul down stairs, across the parking lot, and then up to my apartment. When I finally made it to the apartment, I was covered in sweat and basically looked like a cartoon character shoving my soylent up the last few steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of work, I have a favorite mirror for selfies there. I love it, it’s super flattering, and really really large. But the situation’s a little awkward, because in order to maintain looking professional amongst my coworkers I have to make sure I snap the picture when no one else is there. So I’m always awkwardly looking around making sure the coast is clear and then posing like an idiot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-3FKZ1F2WPw0/U-0KEZVxRtI/AAAAAAAAHPU/ggaEZpMlO1o/w440-h716-no/IMG_2771.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Dramatic mirror seflies&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This weekend is so crazy. I have a friend coming to stay with me for 2 weeks, and she missed her birthday. So I wrapped up a bunch of small things. Then we also have a wedding, an ikea trip, and a bunch of touristy stuff to drag my buddy to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m never going to get any sleep!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ecU9-hR8-II/U-2UqhAbVUI/AAAAAAAAHPM/HlfSHmU6prQ/w617-h716-no/IMG_2777.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;So many presents&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s your weekend looking like?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Don’t cry over spilled milk, a broken elephant or a flat tire.</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I almost cried over two out of three of those today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll fill you in. I have a huge crush on Jonathan Adler. I don’t even know what he looks like, or if he’s a good person. But I love his designs. So when he came out with a cheaper department store line, I bought a ton up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately I had to ship it to my new apartment, and in the process, one of my favorite pieces, an elephant lamp shattered. :( I’ve been super glue-ing him back together, but I’ve had to glue so much, I ran out. Here he is in a mostly fixed state. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-DkiXGQnn_L0/U-uOF9toaII/AAAAAAAAHCc/JmSyqfB2evk/w837-h716-no/IMG_2724.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then today, on the way to work, I got a flat tire on my bike. Which seemed okay, because I had a tube and pump at work. So I worked at replacing the tube (I’m a total bike fixing novice, this took me basically forever), after many attempts to pump my bike, I found out the needle was broken, so the new tube won’t even inflate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here was a glory photo from when I thought I fixed it. Haha. WRONG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/6ghX3zG0Q0a58C0eR-EJHKXSITQEi6rSTgHfdROCIDA=w567-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, my day was amazing. I took a beautiful walk at lunch and came across the most bizarre 80’s style fitness track. You can walk around and stop at all these little stations in the woods to work on different skills. I skipped the fitness stations, but eventually I want to come out and play with the rings station. One of my dream goals for life is to be able to do a pull up, and it could be fun to do some aerial skills on this thing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/loAPNvxCXKdujF5v10SSvcMQfggSCx50DhhmToaDzKs=w567-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soylent today has been good. It’s hard doing an experiment on yourself. Like I’ve felt a little eugh when it comes to digestive issues. Fortunately, I have yet to become a noxious gas machine like some drinkers report. (Knock on wood). But I definitely felt a little on edge today. However, two of my coworkers went home sick. So is it a stomach bug? Soylent? Guess I’ll find out in a few days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-63QYJDPwtOc/U-uQM0rbulI/AAAAAAAAHGY/n8WIgvAJfuE/w548-h716-no/IMG_2727.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My batch today tasted the best yet though. Getting good measurements on a food scale has helped a lot with that. (Since I don’t want to drink a whole 2000 calorie bag). And actually, this is probably disgusting, but I don’t mind it luke warm. I chill it overnight for whatever reason, but I actually kind of enjoy it after it’s gotten back to room temperature. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever, I’m crazy. Hope everyone else’s day went better than my own. :)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Soylent Day Two, as told in selfies.</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been making my daily batch of Soylent the night before. I’ve heard letting sit, makes the liquid less gritty, and also, it gives me more time in the morning to get ready. I’m lazy, so I just measure, blend, and then shove the entire blender in the fridge for the night. (minus the base, guys, I’m not an idiot.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing this means I can wake up, re-blend for a second to reintegrate the oils that have separated (delicious) and go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry in advance for all the selfies. After yesterdays photos, I needed a lot of make up and good angles in today&amp;#39;s post. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/CBPIJcl_0fF156E36fX72nMsovGURT9_nj8CHpo-Wb4=w715-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;Kay plus blender&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day two was as easy, or easier than day one. I actually have a hard time finishing all the soylent by the end of the day. I need to drink more in the morning, because before Soylent, I most naturally ate the most during the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/X7WEWJiQj3U3FK0prUDv7JoAQ5CWblBWoAbV4EnI2bs=w903-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;soylent in blender bottle&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, no one in person has noticed or asked me about my kind of bizarre eating habits, which is really relieving, because honestly, I don&amp;#39;t really want to explain. My suggestion for keeping it under wraps? I&amp;#39;ve been able to fit it all in a blender bottle, which you can see in basically every picture. So it&amp;#39;s pretty small and inconspicuous. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, I&amp;#39;m still worried, I can&amp;#39;t avoid lunch with the coworkers forever. Lately, I&amp;#39;ve been hoping to do non-eating activities during my normal lunch break. I figure walking, and yoga can replace my usual munching. Unfortunately, the last two lunches, I’ve just been doing work at my desk. Uggggh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-u2nb_4jLKjk/U-pS_OfZHMI/AAAAAAAAHAk/4ZrTT4QX3gg/s716-no/IMG_2705-MIX.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Quad selfies&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall though, I feel even, and happy not making choices. The last two days have been fairly stressful, and usually that would mean I’d be chomping my way through snacks and coffee at work. But I haven’t. I mean, I still drink coffee, tea, and other nearly 0 calorie beverages. But I’m not trying to binge my stress away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s silly but, I want magical results at day two, so then I’d feel like I have something great to tell you, or to write about. So far, I haven’t exercised heavily since drinking soylent, but I’m hoping to do a good run tomorrow and see how it goes!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Soylent Day One!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before I tried Soylent, I read about it everywhere. As much as I could. But reading about it was unfulfilling because all of the descriptions are so bland… so neutral…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I get it now! When I got home, it was almost easier to describe what Soylent wasn’t, than what it was. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-6mLCc2lqXWo/U-mSipjQmTI/AAAAAAAAG78/nEnEh1WTcLA/w955-h716-no/IMG_2689.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Measuring my day of food&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like, you know how when you eat food, and it’s your favorite food. The way you eat is happy, the act of consuming is an exciting moment. And you&amp;#39;re like super happy. In your eating. It’s a good food experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But like, you can also have really bad food experiences. You can eat something gross, or something you’re not in the mood for, and you honestly don’t want another bite. It’s a negative food experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soylent is neither of these. I found myself taking sips to keep myself from getting hungry (something I quickly noticed if I got too focused in my work and forgot to drink). But I was neither repulsed or excited to eat more. It’s pretty late at night and I’m only a little more than 2/3rds of the way through 1000 calories of Soylent. But I just sip at it every 20-30 minutes or so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did eat real food today though to ease in. Two apples. One first thing in the morning, and one at 5 pm. I want to make sure my digestive tract doesn’t freak out on me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall it went, well. No reason to be nervous. Granted, everything is easiest the first day. Everything but posting these pictures!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-anY_c5mfPPw/U-mW0P0Z0DI/AAAAAAAAG8M/BWOnKWwdhCE/w922-h532-no/kittstart.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate putting these late night “Before” pictures up, but I want to track my progress and see how soylent affects my overall body. So pardon the awkward photos we snapped at midnight last night. But hopefully, these not so sexy shots will lead to some great afters. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total today ~1240 calories&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Anticipating Soylent</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love the feeling of anticipation right up until I have to take the first step. During the morning, I dream about running, until I hit the moment where I need to lace up my shoes and take off. When I’m just ready to go, I hit that initial dread of the activity. What if it goes wrong? What if I hate it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it’s no surprise that now, the night before I embark on a primarily liquid diet, that I feel that ache in the pit of my stomach. Unboxing soylent. Beautiful. Showing the packaging off to my boyfriend, amazing. But as I go to eat my “last supper”, I feel uneasy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-vbQMTypmDZw/U-TvStzUjUI/AAAAAAAAGzY/DDZ_OMWWWSc/w647-h716-no/IMG_2648.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;My starter kit&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I received my shipment of soylent last week. And because I’d like to pretend my life demands fanfare, I refused to begin a liquid diet on a Thursday, because as any yo-yo dieter knows, diets must begin on a Monday, to give you the entire weekend to binge and feel bad about your choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soylent comes in a ~2000 calorie pack, and advertises ideal nutrition. As I’m a woman, and relatively sedentary, I plan on experimenting with my calorie intake until I find a good medium. Ideally somewhere between 1000-1500, depending on my activity levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-jmBYPGGJJ-o/U-TvekpiidI/AAAAAAAAG1E/bbXrywTLfqA/w850-h716-no/IMG_2657.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;One ‘day’ of Soylent&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this said, I’m still a social person, and I plan on eating normal food over the weekends so my boyfriend isn’t driven insane by my food experimenting, and hopefully so I can’t ruin my digestive system (and other body systems?) too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least I have until tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Lake Shasta Caverns - Shasta day two!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a hot sweaty hike the day before. We opted to get out of the heat, and hide in the caverns of Lake Shasta, where temperatures are much much cooler. Getting to the caverns was pretty low activity, you bought a ticket, walked down to the dock, got on a boat, went across the lake, and then were bussed to the cavern. Despite being sedentary, the views were amaaazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-LhdmCPXMdnA/U-K-11IrUuI/AAAAAAAAGTk/lww3P8YEOVI/w955-h716-no/IMG_2480.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Views of Lake Shasta&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inside the cavern was really amazing (granted, I haven’t really been in many caves). The guide was well rehearsed, and went by a kind of cheesy script that kept the children, and the adults with no attention span paying attention, and away from touching all the rocks. (Which is bad.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-EzpepRdzDsY/U-K_MHPAXiI/AAAAAAAAGWY/ZBI-ZV7F0II/w537-h716-no/IMG_2497.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since people online make a big deal of it, we were hoping the cave might be strenuous. But it’s really mostly sight seeing. We were told it was 80 stories of stairs, but in reality, it’s 80 steps, or 8 stories, and when moving in a group, you basically take this at a snails pace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole cave is pretty amazing, but the best part is the end, with this crazy kind of cathedral formation at the end. This was the only time the guide really paused, and so we were able to convince him to snap a quick picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-TxellRnmXsM/U-LEBhcyuMI/AAAAAAAAGfI/0fbq9wkmoUM/w537-h716-no/IMG_2541.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;J and Kay in da cave&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Castle Crags - Shasta day one!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This summer our vacations have been beautifully formulaic. We choose a place a few hours out from San Francisco. Book a shitty motel in the area. Then hike, bike, and eat the local food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since day one in SF, J has been wanting to go to Shasta. So bam! We did. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-5IiGWdT2Upg/U-K9vta2UkI/AAAAAAAAGOQ/DAkb-vXkHRE/w537-h716-no/IMG_2442.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;We made it!&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-gGut2AlXKqI/U-K8JvIqWlI/AAAAAAAAGFo/i4soP8Met8U/w537-h716-no/IMG_2393.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Rocks!&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because we are nowhere near cool enough, we decided not to actually hike Shasta itself. Mostly since we wanted to spend our time just looking at it. And also because, it takes like a whole day, and it was 108 degrees outside. So hot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ended up at Castle Crags, a pretty sweet hike. We started from a parking area, and climbed. Since we believed the things we read on the internet, we hear this was going to be a 5 mile hike, total. Unfortunately, since we never looked at a map, we didn’t realize that it was 5 miles to the top, and 5 back down. Oops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Ec8vG2XtRLxBrsHopGNMB6vn09VLzOxqTkPV25TtZ5I=w1062-h682-no&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-IOobemrRHlQ/U-K8Au5rl_I/AAAAAAAAGEg/3MUvXsnSovo/w955-h716-no/IMG_2387.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hike had about 2000 ft elevation gain over a 5 mile windy path. And then the last 500 feet was a lot of scrambling up rocks. Which I pretty much hate the most ever. I always feel, regardless of how much actual safety there is, that I’m going to fall down. So after a few minutes of scrambling, I told J to go ahead, and I’d wait. I was tired, it was hot, we were running out of water. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Y8PdFkfn1xo/U-K9gaSGoaI/AAAAAAAAGMw/aAIbmjvNGvE/w403-h716-no/IMG_2431.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;J summits crags. Balla’.&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He made it to the top, it was amazing and beautiful, and I’m still glad I didn’t go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, on the way down, we stopped at this small, .2 mile hike to Indian Springs. Where there was potable water! I have never been so happy in the world ever for potable water. It was beautiful and amazing, and the best thing ever. We drank a lot of spring water, and then ran down the mountain for 5 miles. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a shower that flooded the entire bathroom. But I must say, a crappy motel bed and threadbare blankets never felt so good.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Fourth of July the Works</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m not a firework person. I’m not an America the beautiful person. I don’t get most rah-rah holidays to begin with. But I went to the local fireworks with family, and I took some cool pictures and have to share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-1C8ZLrBs_Q4/U-K5azQXM8I/AAAAAAAAF04/_upJ65ewzsg/w537-h716-no/IMG_2259.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;‘The works’&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though people camped out at the venue all day to get good seats. We arrived like 30 minutes before show time, and snagged great digs right where a funnel cake vendor was closing. (Note to friends, and hey, even enemies. Don’t watch how your funnel cakes are made. I would quicker eat mixed concrete.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The show was set to music, which was actually pretty awesome, and they timed the explosions to hit key points in the songs. There were even little heart fireworks for a song about love. Unfortunately most were upside down, but it’s the thought that counts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite taking about 120 fireworks pictures with my iPhone, none contain the heart. Cool story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-tMmF3a6y9a4/U-K3D1BrSAI/AAAAAAAAFjo/hKx8pK1y-lY/w537-h716-no/IMG_2167.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All together, it was actually pretty cool. Even if it meant I had to listen to Katy Perry’s firework song like 20 times. I was a huge nerd and took a bunch of pictures, filmed the entire finale, and said “oh my god” way too many times. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who knows, maybe I’ll come around on the Fourth of July. Might be my favorite holiday next year.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Berries in the Bay</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I was little, my family used to go apple picking every fall. We’d ride the hay ride, pick more apples than we would ever eat, and buy a dozen apple donuts. I now realize this tradition was more for getting to binge on apple donuts than a love of picking apples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This last weekend, J and I went to go relive my childhood by picking Olallieberries (a cross between a bunch of berries, most notably the blackberry) from a small farm down highway 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-QPtW6iX8xO0/U-K1s5_qJiI/AAAAAAAAFZA/wTdZn39DjvI/w955-h716-no/IMG_2094.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Kay picks berries yo&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were (are?) like children. (And of course, we were the only people there without children, go figure.) We ran around trying to pick all the “best” berries. J kept telling me we had enough, we had too many berries, we would never eat this many. And I was pretty sure I could finish all of the berries in the car ride home. (Spoiler alert: I did not eat all the berries on the way home.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-OIZ9vwBLmzs/U-KwwXP8vyI/AAAAAAAAFWI/a3nQdR0jkzA/w955-h716-no/IMG_2082.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Serious berry haul&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After our serious berry haul, we made our way to Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park. A mouthful of a name, if you ask me. We started aimlessly walking around because we couldn’t find a map, and then ran into an ultra marathon trail run group, who were on their 35th mile. I then felt a little guilty about my long runs being 6 miles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/CBgpwsm27tnbWLWhgB8PO8XYpIv5oOCh9jBQLqHBGXc=w578-h716-no&quot; alt=&quot;But for real, it’s beautiful&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we had no destination, we eventually hit a river that cut off our path. The ultramarathoners were unreal amazing and just ran through the waist deep water like it was nothing. However. I was unprepared, so J and I scrambled across the rocks to get to the other side. Success! Our shoes only got a little wet, and I didn’t fall in. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-dyp46wIbqfo/U-K2YQrQBzI/AAAAAAAAFeQ/f4SlRyv4ukI/w537-h716-no/IMG_2122.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;This is a river&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, after crossing the river, we came upon a bunch of dead animals in the woods, and that seemed like a good sign to turn around, so we did. We hopped back in the car, drove home, and ate all the rest of the berries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should have picked more.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Lazy Bear, the ultimate eating experience</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever find something decidedly cool, from an incredibly uncool place? J and I found out about Lazy Bear, an underground dinner you sign up for lottery style a few months ago. After months of putting our names in, we finally were chosen for this many many course experience. We thought we were cool, and hip, and maybe read it in the New York Times, or heard it from a food loving friend. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But no. It was Yelp. The number one rated “restaurant” in SF. Not so cool. The courses were all amazing, and there are so many, that I won’t describe every one in detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-GC2xJUp4KII/U-Ku5cqjisI/AAAAAAAAFMQ/6BxIMi2tENM/w537-h716-no/IMG_2021.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s begin. I missed snapping photos of some of the initial courses, so, this is not representative of the full meal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-A0mkZkZN9A4/U-Kun0Ymk1I/AAAAAAAAFKI/kWSOLu_mbbI/w537-h716-no/IMG_2010.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A tomato water and jalapeno gel with an oyster in it, and a bite stolen. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A high end take on “chips and dip” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-UaTc6eoyER8/U-KushEDoEI/AAAAAAAAFLA/aDTSZZYc7JQ/w537-h716-no/IMG_2014.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soft shell crab with the most amazing sauce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Homemade brown butter bread, with a side of homemade butter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some sort of fish with compressed fruit on top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-y76u1ifIlEY/U-KvDsKWh1I/AAAAAAAAFNA/sFIDWvhd8b8/w537-h716-no/IMG_2025.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rabbit charcuterie&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-L7dj77MR1MI/U-KvJ_8Au6I/AAAAAAAAFNk/2AdMpAzYJlM/w955-h716-no/IMG_2028.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A take on congee with peas, abalone and cucumber&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-709Xl26z-lU/U-KvYzr4q-I/AAAAAAAAFO8/7HgY-aBZi4k/w955-h716-no/IMG_2035.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Squab. Yum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-p_WsKHEKOqI/U-KvcpNZHII/AAAAAAAAFPk/chQNi1g_S4s/w955-h716-no/IMG_2038.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steak sous vide. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deconstructed pie with bruleed stone fruit and meringue sides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A sorbet and chocolate dessert&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-drAl7e9qH0s/U-KvmTfZzyI/AAAAAAAAFRI/FTOSUWe-ErQ/w537-h716-no/IMG_2046.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some bites to end the meal on, at this point I was stuffed.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Ziplining is for adults too!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our second day in Lake Tahoe, we didn’t want to kill ourselves with another hike, especially since we were snowed on the day before. Buuuuut, we both wanted to see balancing rock before we left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We considered a few activities, kayaking, paddle boarding, zip lining, all the watersports were closed until Memorial Day. I really, really didn’t want to zipline. I thought it’d be super boring, since we did it in Costa Rica. But I caved in, and let J book it. We ended up getting a two for one deal though, and hell, I like coupons. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-MF3Q5JJ772c/U3G58nAFtFI/AAAAAAAABAA/wM2F13TCXSY/w1059-h706-no/kitt-glamour-rock.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;!&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-p2Wu5OSegmM/U3G5t6LhPFI/AAAAAAAAA-0/L9mBHjTelr8/w1059-h706-no/dino-rock.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;!&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;J’s knees hurt, and it didn’t look like the gate to balancing rock was open. So we parked in a little outlet nearby. OMG. Best decision ever. It was like less than half a mile to the site. We ran around and took pictures. Since the rock entrance was closed, we were the only people there. Which made for a quiet morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-U05o7E1MZaQ/U3G59ZWoQ7I/AAAAAAAABAE/mtXwFnpk--0/w1059-h706-no/kitt-holding-rock.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;!&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you’re at balancing rock though, it almost feels like it could fall on you. It didn’t, but it feeeeels like it could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-9qpPDSp4cHA/U3G5yQN2ExI/AAAAAAAAA_M/1FmU55iCiUM/w1059-h706-no/jon-holding-rock.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;!&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-9BQes_JxnJo/U3G6CSF3H2I/AAAAAAAABAs/b1_KVMZ-llU/w477-h716-no/kitt-muscle.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;!&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of things falling, I’m the clumsiest person ever. I totally bit it and fell hard on my hands and knees walking back to the car. At the time, it didn’t seem like a big deal, you know? I just fell. I’m an adult. I should be able to handle it. But as we got on the road, I realized that I was bleeding through my yoga pants. We picked up some bandaids and alcohol wipes and cleaned up before getting to the high ropes course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-i3orpttFHkk/U3WlqtTCPYI/AAAAAAAABDs/x5iwFnu546A/w504-h672-no/2014-05-11+13.42.47.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;!&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dude. It was insane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me first point out that we were the only childless adults at the facility. But once we got past that, it was so cool. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-F_vh07mAtTA/U3WlrlNLctI/AAAAAAAABDU/fxL5zrvrpx4/s672-no/2014-05-11+15.11.44.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;!&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, they rigged up 5 different levels of treetop courses. They all involved some level of balancing, climbing, jumping, and zip lining. You would clip in and climb up a ladder, onto a platform, have to tightrope across to the next platform, and then skateboard in mid-air into a weirdly woven web that you climb across to a zipline. And repeat with a billion different challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-vfE1FnLv0nI/U3WlqBLu4UI/AAAAAAAABDE/arS7FNkUljk/s672-no/2014-05-11+14.32.30+HDR.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;!&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did every single one of them. It was crazy fun. This was also the Sunday of Mother’s Day, so there were a lot of moms there. I felt really bad at some points because a lot of the moms, despite being in decent to good shape, were really afraid of failing at the courses, so they didn’t even try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-2V7j8TJf0EM/U3WlrE5onqI/AAAAAAAABD4/awH9-tJZTIY/w896-h672-no/2014-05-11+13.56.19.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;!&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be fair though, it was hard. The next day I was so sore, I wanted to puke.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Tahoe Adventures. Or how to get both sunburn and hypothermia in the same day.</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you’re not living near your mom, but all your friends are booked for mothers day, it’s a sweet time to go away. J (the boyfriend) and I decided to head up a few hours north to Lake Tahoe to get active. We weren’t traveling in style by any means. We stayed in a sleazy, but incredibly cheap motel. Despite kind of being a baby about these things, I have to admit, it wasn’t actually that bad. It barely cost us anything. And though the room smelled of stale smoke, and our blankets were a little thin and ripped, we barely spent any time here, and the cost cutting was worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ALSpo8GhuWg/U3G6BswcjqI/AAAAAAAABAc/yCWLKuDD7_s/w1059-h706-no/kitt-jon-emerald-bay-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;K &amp;amp; J at Emerald Bay&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wanted to do a bunch with our weekend away. We expected a big hike and some kayaking. It was supposed to rain day one, but it was only a 20% chance, so we decided to risk our giant hike on the first day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hit up Emerald Bay. My favorite hike so far in Tahoe. It’s a little C-shaped bay with gorgeous mountain views, rock formations, and a formidable waterfall. My advice, don’t even plan to park near the trailhead. On our way to the trail were so over-excited when we saw the top of the waterfall and the gorgeous scenery that we spent a ton of time before even getting to the trailhead to get pictures. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-7XMMRnZaJz0/U3G54uBbo0I/AAAAAAAAA_0/_GgdAPETEYA/w1059-h706-no/kitt-emerald-bay.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Kitt at Emerald Bay&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-vmsdh8wRBns/U3G6CrBx5ZI/AAAAAAAABBM/3cEAwTKPc58/w1059-h706-no/kitt-top-waterfall.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;So many pictures of Kitt at Emerald Bay&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started the descent from the parking lot to the trailhead around 1pm, and took even more time to play around photographing the waterfall that was half a mile away. Despite a disappointing winter, there’s still enough snow melting to sport a raging falls. Armed with a new camera, and a lot of energy from morning caffeine, we spent an hour playing around with shots in the falls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-8FrHiYUeBPU/U3G5ptYPomI/AAAAAAAAA-Y/u5EXIuhmAn4/w1059-h706-no/artsy-waterfall.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Waterfalls!&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day was beautiful, it was a brisk but sunny 50 degrees. We started on what we planned to be a 12 mile hike, out to the next state park (D L Bliss) and back. Emerald Bay is beautiful, you see amazing coastal views, hike a slightly variated trail, and enjoy the mountains and the bay. It’s not a hard trail by any stretch, just long and a little windy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-1E5SI_WcDXc/U3G-1CLYXgI/AAAAAAAABBc/pJtpDINsxqM/w896-h672-no/laketahoecollage.png&quot; alt=&quot;Collage of all my pictures !&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few miles in, the sky started to drop these tiny balls of snow. It was like being showered with little dippin’ dots. We thought this was adorable, and funny. J and I figured, it’s better than rain. The little ice balls just bounced off us as we walked. Note to self, if it starts precipitating, don’t continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ZRAe8SbZ74I/U3G_Tc2YPVI/AAAAAAAABB4/hUXa0Y1tXlk/w504-h672-no/2014-05-10+16.16.14.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;J in snow&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got to the half-way point, 6 miles in, and snow started just pouring from the sky. It was so thick, you could barely see a few feet in front of you. Armed with only hoodies and athletic pants we trekked back. It was adventurous and stupid. We became walking snowmen, with snow sticking to our hair and cotton clothes. At some points it was like hiking through a snow globe and at other points we felt like we were stuck in the arctic.  The last mile, my body was wet with a miserable mix of sweat and snow. But looking back on it, despite the cold and the snow, it was worth it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ZaVky7eMOKI/U3G_T3_8wiI/AAAAAAAABB8/6YjDIrkLo40/w504-h672-no/2014-05-10+16.14.23.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Walks in snow!&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But of course, as soon as we got to the car (and brushed all the snow off of it). The sky cleared up, and the day went back to 50 degrees. At least we didn’t get snowed on day 2. :)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hello Hello Hello... Aloha</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Living in SF gives you more of an excuse to jet off to Hawaii. It&amp;#39;s closer than New York, Boston, and Florida, and despite crossing an ocean, you don&amp;#39;t have to suffer through customs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went recently on a three day &amp;quot;work&amp;quot; trip. Which is to say that work paid for the trip, but I (nor my teammates) didn&amp;#39;t actually get any work done. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My team stayed at the Kaanapali Westin in Maui. The resort was kind of faux exotic. When you entered there was this giant manmade waterfalls that they had trapped a variety of wild birds and koi in. So that when you exited checkin you were greeted by flamingos and macaws chilling under a giant waterfall. It&amp;#39;s definitely bizarre, and seemed a little trying too hard. (But yo, I still took pictures of it)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-o3xOnhPnJgc/U2V-pR5S8QI/AAAAAAAABsU/7nkH5-WUNKc/w924-h693-no/14+-+20&quot; alt=&quot;Crazy entrance way&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hawaii is a vacation spot that doesn&amp;#39;t take much work if you&amp;#39;re coming from the mainland. Everyone speaks the same language, your GPS works, and you don&amp;#39;t really have to do much to have fun. While it&amp;#39;s nice for relaxing, it can be almost too effortless. Given the lax environment, I spent a lot of my time walking along the beach, reading outside in perfect weather and just chilling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/bkLyvPG8l9eJeGIYPaDa4UaROPbUO6vBbJFiuZt2QoU=w934-h693-no&quot; alt=&quot;Collage of Hawaii&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just recently moved to a new team at work, and wanted to impress my coworkers and meet people. So I probably tried too hard. I was extroverted, stayed out late, danced, introduced myself to everyone and basically made sure I met everyone. It was a nice mix of work (meeting everyone in the world, omg.) and play (laying on the beach and people watching)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-dfQ179ICuGs/U2V-pZFIDwI/AAAAAAAABsg/3HcsFC3keyY/w924-h693-no/14+-+27&quot; alt=&quot;View from my room&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately I got in my two favorite things in Hawaii, Acai Bowls (omg, learned to make these at home. Going to eat them forever.) and Surfing (also should do this at home, buuuuut.)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Cataract Falls, or how to climb the Eiffel Tower of San Francisco</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A week or two ago we had a completely open day. The weather&amp;#39;s been great, and so we wanted to get outdoors and try a new trail, stretch our legs out a bit from a long week of screens, screens and more screens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the boyfriend and I hit up Cataract Falls. When we got there it was chilly. Like, when you live in California, sometimes you forget how cold it can get. We planned the hike around a 6 mile loop that promised coastal views and ended at Cataract Falls. The coastal bit, honestly, was just so boring. Basically no elevation change, gentle weather, and mediocre views. It would have been just as good to walk on a track, or in a mall, god.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-l-G2xUF9wVI/U02toZo_udI/AAAAAAAAAQM/SmToLc4_m9I/w955-h716-no/14+-+20&quot; alt=&quot;Alt text&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five miles through, and with way too much energy left, we made it to the falls area. Not tired, we decided to tack on an extra 5 mile loop to the hike to get to the base of the waterfall and back. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we took off, running down the falls trail, jumping down stairs, speedng through straight paths. I had that nagging feeling you get in the back of your mind, &amp;quot;Hmmm, this seems like a lot of downhill.&amp;quot; But, like an idiot, I ignored the fact that I was basically hurtling my body down a mountain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-jj7eWdlnkg0/U02toc6YQcI/AAAAAAAAAQo/yzTdVWoy93Y/w537-h716-no/14+-+16&quot; alt=&quot;Alt text&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The water was gorgeous, and made up for our lack luster hike. But fuck man, we had to climb all the way back up. 1,400 feet elevation to scale, basically 140 floors to tackle. Initially, I was dying, and expected to vomit, curl up and die (I think my boyfriend was embarrassed of me at this point. Haha). But after the first few &amp;quot;flights&amp;quot; of steps, my body just stopped caring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, it sucked the whole way up. I was a disgusting sweaty mess. But I stopped taking breaks and just pushed through the bulk of it. I felt pretty bad ass. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-BZk_KutFwlo/U02toXyfGyI/AAAAAAAAAMQ/1jaox2je8G0/w955-h716-no/14+-+25&quot; alt=&quot;Alt te&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got to the top and thought we were basically done with the loop, but we still had a mile and a half to go. Longest mile and a half of our lives, we were cold, tired, and our quads were ready to fall off. When we got to the car, all I wanted to do was sit, forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ended up ordering in and just chilling, accomplishing nothing more than a super steep 10 mile hike that day. &lt;/p&gt;
