	<p>I have to say, while I usually don’t love looking at my own mediocre pictures of food that I secretly take while (I hope) my coworkers aren’t looking. I get some perverse joy out of seeing what other people are eating, and so in that, I have to indulge you in my Wednesday food lineup. If you too love looking at what others are eating check out <a href="http://peasandcrayons.com/">more here</a>.</p>

<p>This is food no filter. So what I ate, I snapped. Basically, all my meals are provided by my workplace. So I’m a little constrained with what I eat.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/TJJMFn1QlUzjpfCuBH3DXkXqBDnOY3uJ0lLhYfVIBFA=w890-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Breakfast is usually fruit + eggs or cottage cheese. (Plus a giant coffee, black). This is just the most simple meal that will tide me over until lunch. I have this basically every day but Friday. :)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-MfHRSq3-7l4/VEgCW9NYkEI/AAAAAAAAMSE/H7LNXJd4D2A/w955-h716-no/IMG_4034.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>We had a food truck here today that served salads!</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-aSb6075UWVw/VEgCeFI6DhI/AAAAAAAAMTA/pe7EZep8nlY/w955-h716-no/IMG_4039.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Tuna poke salad with carrots, cucumbers, brown rice and a miso dressing. Super delicious but, way too much rice. My bowl looked like this at the end of lunch:</p>

<p>I’m a person who lives off of snacks. So in the afternoon, I had a little of:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-pU8tj7pG63c/VEfmprnQHvI/AAAAAAAAMUQ/0ZaKsmMxD3w/w604-h716-no/IMG_4028.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>And some of</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/XgrbgZ6rEWWi411MZwXCIOK0VHmQmccHA2lUm-TxMfQ=w537-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>I’m not much of a dinner person, so taking one from Oliva Pope, I’ll be having a bowl of popcorn, but no wine. I’d snap a picture, but I haven’t eaten it yet.</p>

<p>Over all, I’d probably like to add some more vegetables to my day, and maybe a little protein. I’m hoping to pick up some Quest bars on the suggestion of a friend, because while my body handles sugar substitutes pretty well, I become a maniac on sugar. Maybe next Wednesday I’ll throw in a real salad. :)</p>

<p>In true form, I can’t end this post without this awesome and hilariously flattering selfie I took and then applied a million filters to this morning. My toggling with weird image settings game is getting so strong.</p>

<p>I know pumpkin is like the it food of the month. I obviously need to work on my pumpkin game. Have you been indulging in any fall favorites?</p>

	<h1><a href="/10-21-2014/improving-seawheeze.html">How I’m improving for Seawheeze 2015.</a></h1>
	<div class="metadata">
		Posted October 21, 2014.

	</div>
	<p>Seawheeze 2014 was one of the best experiences of my life. It was my first half marathon. I was able to travel to Vancouver to do a beautiful run. I was so in love with it, I signed up only a month after finishing, just to run it again this year.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-eLhyEkexHl0/U-KbONyZxWI/AAAAAAAADgI/g644W8tVHFk/s716-no/IMG_1567.JPG" alt="Run selfie"></p>

<p>That said, it was my first half, and there are a lot of things I’d like to improve on the next time.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Run other races. Seawheeze was my first half marathon, but it was also my first real race. I didn’t start running until 14 weeks before the race, and unfortunately, I couldn’t even fit a real, organized 5k in before it. But this year, I’m running a bunch of different races. I figure, it’s good to figure out how the whole race circus works before you run 13 miles of one.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/--IGr8r8VJnA/U-Ki8-ohixI/AAAAAAAAEM4/j4mgzjUiJ6k/w640-h617-no/IMG_1591.PNG" alt=""></p></li>
<li><p>Train early. While I’m perversely proud that I went from couch to half marathon in a little under 4 months, I think it’s a pretty crazy goal if you aren’t incredibly devoted. I’m excited to have time to improve upon my runs, not just knock out specific mileage in hopes of hitting 13 of them by a certain date.</p></li>
<li><p>Cross train. The app strongly suggests yoga and cross training alongside the running. As a naive, but busy person. I figured. I’m running a race, I just need the running part. So I skipped all the suggested yoga, and cross training, and just ran. This caused a lot of unnecessary tightness, and pain, and if I was more of an idiot, potential injury.  </p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-S3xLpftBP7M/VEWLBo8yDbI/AAAAAAAAMN4/IZrL6rrVwhk/w403-h715-no/IMG_4018.PNG" alt=""></p></li>
<li><p>Train outdoors more. I love, and will make every argument for treadmill running. I can set a pace, turn off my brain, watch bad reality tv on my phone, and put a giant fan on myself since I sweat more than anyone I know. But! If you’re going to run outside, you might want to do some outside runs. I’m hoping to fit more in, or find someone to run with in the park. (And yes, I do photograph my silly treadmill runs.)</p></li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-TtsJz_VVYeM/U-KwtL-q_oI/AAAAAAAAMOU/Guj6MM381Fk/w1038-h658-no/IMG_2079.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Even with my newbie mistakes, signing up to run a half marathon on a whim was one of the best things I could have ever done. I’m just hoping to document my gaffes so I don’t let it happen twice. :)</p>

<p>Any half marathon, or just running tips you learned the hard way?</p>

	<p>I read on Friday night that Adobe was unveiling a new mural in our neighborhood at 8 am Saturday morning. However, there was no way I was going to get J up before noon to look at one mural. (Heaviest. Sleeper. Alive.)</p>

<p>So on Sunday after brunch we stopped by to get a look.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Bfiy7YORjd5YW-u9A0-8N92C92z7vizWVNk9mjAdRs=w874-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>The goal, if I remember correctly, is to spark creative moments for passers by. The artist figures people keep their heads down and ignore their surroundings when they walk, and murals like these make you take notice of your surroundings. People were definitely noticing it when we were there, there was practically a queue waiting to snap photos.</p>

<p>The mural is in a larger “park” area, that often holds fitness classes, has super adorable coffee and juice bars, and is generally a fun place to explore. And so we did!</p>

<p>The fitness section had some serious monkey bars.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-BnsuXs5clUs/VEQhzThqV-I/AAAAAAAAMJ4/CtTdY8Oukiw/w537-h716-no/IMG_4003.JPG" alt="J on monkey bars"></p>

<p>J did them with ease. I tried, but it was a total failure. Since most monkey bars are in parks for kids, I always have the safety net of being able to put my feet down. But these were definitely designed with adults in mind. Both J and I had to seriously hop to grab. On the first bar my sweaty palms slipped right off. One day I’m going to go back with some chalk and more resolve, and try again.</p>

<p>The last installation was this bucket list inspired piece: </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/bWidfx-XZD_sw9aIhh9D-TmdIP35eMCNYrx72nYF1HY=w940-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>I loved some of the answers, like: “Do a barrel roll.” or “Kiss someone I love in the rain” or “Help beat cancer.”</p>

<p>It’s silly, but one of the more frivolous goals I have is to be able to do the splits. I didn’t put it on the board, and I’m not sure that it’s something I need to do before I die. But seeing what everyone else has on their bucket list made me think of it.</p>

<p>What’s something you want to do before you die?</p>

	<p>Growing up in the midwest, I’m not particularly accustomed to seafood outside of fish, and maybe shrimp in a cocktail. </p>

<p>So when a good friend was having her birthday at a state park, two hours north of San Francisco, where the plan was to shuck oysters. I was pumped! </p>

<p>And petrified. I’ve never taken a shell off of anything more than a hermit crab.</p>

<p>The location was beautiful. To be fair, every beach in California is beautiful, but Point Reyes really has some amazing shoreline views. J and I hiked (if you can call it that) up a short paved cliffside road to watch some surfers and enjoy the view before the other party-goers got there.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-rkS27TFvE80/VEMFAEjwjGI/AAAAAAAAMEA/6ZcpuIdQzFk/w955-h716-no/IMG_3942.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>About 20 people came, a pretty good turn out for a seaside birthday. Unfortunately, the most familiarity anyone in the group had with shucking oysters was a few YouTube videos. </p>

<p>However, both sea otters and gulls are pretty good at getting oysters open. So we figured a few 20 somethings with knives couldn’t do too poorly.</p>

<p>After success with the first mollusc, everyone wanted to get their hands on one.</p>

<p>We had 100 oysters, a bunch of sides, and some gorgeous picnic tables laid out by the beach. Turns out, even for a midwestener, getting oysters out of their shells isn’t very difficult, and eating them fresh with a little lemon and hot sauce is one of the best things ever. </p>

<p>Friends, sun, sand and sea were the perfect way to spend a Saturday morning.</p>

<p>How’s your weekend going? Try anything new recently?</p>
