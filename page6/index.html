	<p>If you’ve taken a peek at my Instagram. You may have noticed I was in Hawaii last week! Normally, my boyfriend and I are connected to our laptops all day, every day for work. We wanted to get away from the bright screens, and so we took a laptop-free vacation.</p>

<p>J and I left bright and early in the morning, I was super excited and overly awake on the plane while J fell asleep the moment we hit the seats. Fortunately, we scored some great exit row seats so I was able stretch my legs.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/643vSB_GhE9l9C7UJzRK2UDbTw3a-WSxEoEKFIrLSpg=w667-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>The minute the plane landed, we went to grab a bite to eat. We stopped at Da Kitchen to pick up some local cuisine.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bi4cp5quugepcfO5j9NJsKi54VOQfTtzjLFdUAwwoOQ=w587-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Despite my smile, turns out traditional Hawaiian food isn’t really our thing. I got a pork sandwich, and J ordered a giant Loco Moco (not knowing what a loco moco was, and not knowing that he was ordering the biggest one on the menu). Da Kitchen did a great job cooking our meal, but it was a little too much, and too greasy.</p>

<p>To pay for our food sins we decided to start the afternoon off hiking.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-fmMhRvAEhP4/VB-pmA6CsSI/AAAAAAAALbk/BRcUUpVNCAM/w1062-h708-no/bestofwaiheejon.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>We hit the Waihee Ridge trail up around 1pm. Despite everything on the internet telling us this hike would only be good in the morning, or that finding the parking and trailhead was difficult, we had no problem with either. Google Maps saved the day once again.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/3GxWU7p8FWWH9p38yPUtsupnU9ZK6ZQ9-KR-dZDmJ78=w496-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>The ridge trail is basically all uphill, and has a bunch of really beautiful lookout points. Every time I thought we couldn’t gain more altitude, we did! It switches between forested and exposed, and is definitely on the challenging side of trails. J and I loved it. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-VaD2BzeHpAg/VB-oUxW8ZeI/AAAAAAAALUA/d5-22uGLMwg/w1062-h708-no/IMG_0578.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Despite the serious climb, the views are totally worth it, you feel like you’re in the middle of a Jurassic Park set. The clouds, waterfalls, and super lush foliage are unlike anything in Northern California. The only thing I’d change? J and I only brought one water bottle for the both of us. We definitely needed two.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-8REPgwSmKTU/VB-oZbsPnYI/AAAAAAAALUg/21BC88kBKAI/w1062-h708-no/IMG_0654.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>We ended the day at the Mana Kai Maui in Kihei. Due to a little switch up with our room, we ended up upgraded into one of their condos. The condo was totally adequate, nothing to write home about. But the balcony, or lanai as all of Maui (and possibly Hawaii seems to call it), was amazing.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-igiayIil4to/VB9yiRsMDBI/AAAAAAAAKF0/NcEN12L-ihw/w1062-h708-no/IMG_0678.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>With that view, we spent a lot of time on the balcony watching the sunset, the surf, and just chilling. Since the condo came with a kitchen we were sure to grab fruit at the local market. I seriously improved my pineapple cutting skills. I’m a real fruit ninja now.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/74r5CwLOW4-ZWpZckwLXx-mp2OYqSQakj5hFjF7dKDM=w1062-h713-no" alt=""></p>

<p>But we’re home now! I’ll do some entries over the next few days about the rest of our trip. While vacation is nice, I’m excited to be back into routine. Soylent, running, yoga and work.</p>

	</div>
	<p>I think all I’ve been doing lately is working, sleeping, and signing up for races.</p>

<p>One of the reasons I keep signing up, is to keep myself running. So I want to pad out my races to approximately one a month. I&#39;m almost covered until the end of the year. But it&#39;s a little spotty in some places. I like doing races that (generally) don&#39;t require fundraising, don&#39;t have colors thrown at you, or zombies, or photoshoots, aren&#39;t super religious, and are relatively fun. With that said, here’s what I’ve got so far.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-YpDOnJqE-Fk/VBPgFDi14yI/AAAAAAAAIMA/FtNav66dzZ8/w650-h350-no/Screen%2BShot%2B2014-09-12%2Bat%2B11.04.49%2Bpm.png" alt=""></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://run10feed10.com">Run 10 Feed 10 - October 2014</a></strong></p>

<p>A philanthropic 10k put on by Women’s Health. I’m super excited because I’ll get to run over the Golden Gate Bridge. (I’ve only ever driven under it. Ooops)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-mAseAeTd5H8/VBPgFNSDXII/AAAAAAAAIMI/vfH8SS9S7wA/w650-h580-no/Screen%2BShot%2B2014-09-12%2Bat%2B11.05.21%2Bpm.png" alt=""></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://theuglysweaterrun.com">Ugly Sweater 5k - November 2014</a></strong></p>

<p>My family’s celebrating Thanksgiving with the ugliest 5k of all. I’m super pumped for this 5k. Both to run alongside (and beat) my siblings. But also because I’ve put together the most hideous Christmas apparel of all time!</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ABozaaNUJpw/VBPfI5BY7gI/AAAAAAAAILM/kkfAvpWU7OU/w679-h177-no/Screen%2BShot%2B2014-09-12%2Bat%2B11.06.01%2Bpm.png" alt=""></p>

<p><strong><a href="www.hotchocolate15k.com">Hot Chocolate 15k - January 2015</a></strong></p>

<p>I chose this race because a 15k is like the lazy man’s half. And I’m lazy. And it’s super flat. And there’s chocolate at the end of it. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-PLYtiwGpx90/VBPfJf2VfcI/AAAAAAAAILQ/welfgHWRpFk/w711-h350-no/Screen%2BShot%2B2014-09-12%2Bat%2B11.06.51%2Bpm.png" alt=""></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.seawheeze.com/">SeaWheeze Half - August 15, 2015</a></strong></p>

<p>But I got tickets! A race I love so much, I signed up a year in advance. This was literally one of my best experiences this year. It sold out in under a half hour, but both my mom and I managed to sign up.</p>

	</div>
	<p>Things have been a little crazy here. Most notably this morning I signed both my mom and myself up for SeaWheeze 2015! Woo.</p>

<p>I was super excited for it this year.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/4WtimBfywF1VYbcARzGbXxdfiaif8Z0co0A3F0704Qk=w894-h205-no" alt=""></p>

<p>I wanted to recap my experience with Soylent so far. And hit up what I’ve loved, and what I’ve strugged with. Let me give you a week by week of how it’s been.</p>

<p><strong>Week 1</strong> - Stayed on Soylent all 5 week days. 1200 calories a day on Soylent, uncounted otherwise.</p>

<p><strong>Week 2</strong> - Horrible stressful week with only 1 day Soylent. Let’s not even talk about my eating habits. (I may or may not have gorged myself on a back of mallowcreme pumpkins.)</p>

<p><strong>Week 3</strong> - 2 days Soylent, 500 calories. 5 days muggle food with general moderation.  </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ZU9U9bjti_M/U-zkJH1cDUI/AAAAAAAAIEI/DCMplJYmIRw/w429-h416-no/IMG_2756.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>So what’s going on in my blender?</p>

<p><strong>The Good:</strong><br>
1) I’m recognizing that I have a super weird relationship with food. So when I’m drinking Soylent, it’s helping me get away from some of that. For example, when drinking an adequate amount of Soylent to the point where I’m not hungry. I get this feeling like “I deserve a snack.” Even though I am perfectly satisfied, I’m finding I reward myself with food, even though I didn’t do anything award worthy.</p>

<p>2) Soylent, when drinking it, is not unpleasant.</p>

<p>3) I get a lot more done on days with Soylent. I usually take a brief walk at lunch, clear my head. Finish work earlier, and have more time for activities in the evening.</p>

<p>4) When I drink soylent, I actively want less food days I’m not drinking soylent.  </p>

<p><strong>The Not-So-Good:</strong><br>
1) I feel like a jerk turning my team down for lunch daily, or not being able to meet up with a friend after work. I’m not ready to “out” my Soylent habits yet, so a 5 day spread wasn’t working for me.</p>

<p>2) Even though Soylent tastes great. I hate the way it smells, makes my house smell, makes me smell. It actively makes me not want to drink it, even though the taste, and general experience is great. I have this mental block before I take the first sip, where I think. Shit, this is going to be horrible.</p>

<p>3) Since meals are provided for me at work, this is actually more effort than not doing Soylent.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-uan3B8_4bp4/VAU1KjXdEkI/AAAAAAAAID4/FsGt0Lpv8Vs/w963-h716-no/IMG_3009.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>The food I&#39;ve been wanting to eat with coworkers.</p>

<p>So as you can see from my little week break down. I’m shaking it up and doing a 5:2 split. (5 days off, two days on). Which I may move up to a 4:3 split once I get back from vacationing in Hawaii next week. </p>

<p>I think the most important thing is to find a sustainable way to incorporate this into my life. Honestly, the 5 days on spread, it wasn’t fitting my lifestyle. So I’m trying a method that mimics intermittent fasting more. I’ve liked it (so far) more than fasting, because Soylent even at low calories, takes away any hunger or cravings.</p>

<p>What’s been working for you so far?</p>

	<p>Getting things done over this long weekend. My closet has been the ultimate mess since I moved in. I bought these cheap wire storage bins to store clothes. Spoiler alert, they didn&#39;t work. So I spent today re-doing my closet/dressing area. First order of business, get a real dresser.</p>

<p>I went to Ikea, even though every time I build a piece of their furniture I promise myself I will never ever go Ikea again. But then they&#39;re so cheap and easy that I forget the building hell, and I keep coming back. </p>

<p>Final product. I still need to hang some things for more color!</p>
