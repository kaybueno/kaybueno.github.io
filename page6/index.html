	<p>Getting things done over this long weekend. My closet has been the ultimate mess since I moved in. I bought these cheap wire storage bins to store clothes. Spoiler alert, they didn&#39;t work. So I spent today re-doing my closet/dressing area. First order of business, get a real dresser.</p>

<p>I went to Ikea, even though every time I build a piece of their furniture I promise myself I will never ever go Ikea again. But then they&#39;re so cheap and easy that I forget the building hell, and I keep coming back. </p>

<p>Final product. I still need to hang some things for more color!</p>

<p>Have any fall cleaning planned?</p>

	</div>
	<p>Looking back at SeaWheeze, my only wish is that I would have taken more pictures. Because, the more I think about it, the more I realize, everything we did there was beautiful. Our B&amp;B (O Canada House) was this amazingly cute Victorian, with fancy plated breakfast, yummy pastries, cute puppies, and the sweetest owner. The weather was perfect all 3 days, the scenery was gorgeous. Really, you couldn&#39;t have asked for a better weekend.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I&#39;m not perfect, so I mostly gawked at everything around me, and didn&#39;t snap near enough photos. After my mom and I hit up the Showcase Store, we went to pick up my race package. :)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/K0COu1cmh3Hs31a86jn8F_fWN80FTY_1Fa_J_6N3dhM=w668-h672-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Talk about no line, we waited maybe 5 minutes to get to a booth and grab the goods. My favorite part of the pack? The Chip Wilson race chip. And the water bottle that we got as swag. I was pretty tired from the early morning, so after getting everything we went back to the B&amp;B, grabbed breakfast, napped, and walked back to the convention center to check out (but not participate in) yoga.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/XTH938gCtrZco3VsTXWPxJyCFGAdV6fDU4WL9MfM3_I=w875-h672-no" alt=""></p>

<p>It was surreal to watch a few hundred people doing yoga in the open air. As much as I wanted to join, I&#39;m kind of glad I didn&#39;t. I am out of yoga practice and would have been sore the next day. Which I&#39;ve heard isn&#39;t good when you&#39;re running a half marathon. </p>

<p>Speaking of. The next morning, I woke up at 4:30 (again...) to get in line for the half. Since it was my longest run ever, I was incredibly incredibly nervous about doing things right. I was nervous about eating at all before the race, and ended up just having a piece of pumpkin bread before heading over to the convention center. I took a picture in front of the brunch sign before running, so I&#39;m pretty sure I didn&#39;t deserve anything yet. (But at least I looked good at this point.)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-piiEleVflbs/VAFfqPTSJ0I/AAAAAAAAHys/hNLWjrrhgwE/w446-h621-no/seawheeze3.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>We were led through a really rousing warm up of jumping jacks and other light exercise. Unfortunately, the warm up was at least 50 minutes before my wave (1:10) made it to the starting line. So I&#39;m not sure it helped much other than to get me in the spirit of the run. It was super easy to find the pace beavers, and they pumped us up, and gave the whole wave tattoos to help track our times.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-vzR8vdAkztU/U_jP9OilNcI/AAAAAAAAHiQ/-UDU7R2l-oo/w537-h716-no/IMG_2893.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Unfortunately, I&#39;m bad at kilometers, so this wasn&#39;t very useful. But it did stay on, despite all the sweating. I was able to keep pace with the group until about mile 6. Where I started to falter. And by mile 9, I was ka-put. I was a little bummed, but since I had kind of slacked on my long runs right before the race, it&#39;s really what I should have expected.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the race was a lot of first timers half marathoners, so I wasn&#39;t the only one who got tired around this point. The worst part of faltering early was that the last few miles of the race are gorgeous. Runners are weaving around Stanley Park. But at this point all I was focused on was FINISH THE RACE and DON&#39;T DIE. So I hardly paid attention. </p>

<p>My mom was the best cheerleader though! She caught me at 3 of the cheering stations. Unfortunately photographing runners is both hard, and super unflattering. So here&#39;s an okay looking back-shot of me and quite a few other runners going around the water.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-LWw4Cc_78u4/VAFfp5BMnFI/AAAAAAAAHzA/RiCrw690Prs/w446-h639-no/seawheeze-2.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>But! I did finish, without medic nor dying. And coming in at 2:29 means that I&#39;ll definitely PR SeaWheeze 2015!</p>

	<p>Sorry for the lack of updates. Between Seawheeze, and coming back to a lot of work. I haven&#39;t really had time to update. </p>

<p>Seawheeze was amazing, I loved every minute of it. But I can&#39;t lie, the reason I originally signed up for the half, was to get a crack at the showcase store. You see, Lululemon puts out a bunch of limited edition merchandise for the race, and getting one of a kind yoga pants was basically my dream come true. But, honestly, I felt kind of guilty just flying out for new clothes. So I signed up, and trained (a little less than I should have) for a half marathon.</p>

<p>This is my re-telling of the showcase store. Fair warning, this is pretty much the reason I decided to run this race, so I have some serious bias.</p>

<p>My mom also came out for the weekend to cheer me on, and she&#39;s pretty much down for everything, so when I told her about the store, she was all set to wake up at 4:30 am and head over. It was an early morning, but we got into a very nice corralled line at 4:45 am. At this point there was still a lot of space, approximately 40-50 people in line total, with chairs and blankets everywhere. We brought a blanket, spread out, chatted with people next to us, and chilled until 6 am. Despite it still being dark out, everyone was amazingly friendly, and I met so many great people. It made me feel less like a crazy person knowing others were up at 4 am too. :)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/RDyOwbhlZ50QcI2Y5Qd9L151ymaq_Rfl2Prn70ujffk=w608-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>I have to say, getting there right before 5 was clutch, because at 5:00 am, the line started to really heat up. The whole queue probably doubled to about 100, if not 150 people by 5 or 5:15. </p>

<p>At around 6:30, the line was all the way around the convention center. (I know because I had to pee. My suggestion, hop into the Fairmont hotel near by. Almost all the guests are runners, and honestly, we all looked alike.) But when I came back Lululemon had hired had all these cute characters, who were walking around, chatting with the line. Sorry for the potato quality of my photos, my iphone and lack of sleep combined didn&#39;t help.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/iP6kUEs-mbVbcu9oQRLk-GomOZDyQC9TgDr6yv4fIS8=w406-h715-no" alt=""></p>

<p>While waiting, my mom and I heard horror stories from other people in line about how in previous years, there was no limit, so the goal was to grab everything in your size. So originally, we planned to divide and conquer, just grabbing everything we could find in both sizes. The doors started opening at 7 am. And they had a volunteer/worker at the door clicking down the amount of people they let in each wave. Fortunately, we were the first group in, and everything was set up beautifully. Each area had little balloons marking the size of that area. So we abandoned our grab each other everything, ran to our respective sizes, and started grabbing stuff.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/KzA9FhUij5IV_m1SJuJ6jtGfpbHUhP46BjMp5NMuYQE=w1056-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>My suggestions here. Take everything you think you might want. Duffel bags went within the first group. Know your sizes, because it can be hard to grab product after people have ravaged it. But ultimately, have fun. This felt like the best shopping spree ever. I was like a little kid in a candy store. After we grabbed all the things we wanted, we heaped them down in a pile and started sorting our top 15. We came to our choices pretty quickly. Tried a few things on for size (mostly scuba hoodies and coats) and checked out. The process was easy, flawless, and we were on our way in about 20 minutes.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/B_hHhpBgXZgF-9VZxYT1Ic3_zuzcREad0uzClTW3U8U=w955-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Later that afternoon, I talked to some girls at the wonderful B&amp;B we stayed at. They arrived to the store after a run at around 7, and waited in line for over 2 hours, and a lot of stuff was sold out. While they thought our morning sounded crazy, personally, as an early riser, waking up two hours earlier than them, and waiting for the same amount of time, seemed worth the amazing stuff we got. Overall my haul looked like:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/f3_Deex7zhgaTtTjDfYiiacITZ_Rk30nceJnLdPY3Ro=w955-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>I really focused on the rainbow swirled pattern, and the graphic dark lines for the pants. I plan on taking some more individual images of different pieces later this week. The showcase store was an amazing experience, and was coordinated so well. It was a great way to meet other runners, and a really exciting start to the weekend. My mom and I both maxed out our 15 pieces, and I&#39;ve really loved the stuff I got. </p>

<p>Race recap soon!</p>
