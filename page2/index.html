	<h1><a href="/1-15-2015/dessert-is-not-mandatory.html">How I’m eating in January: Dessert isn't Mandatory</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		January 15, 2015
	</div>

	<p>You know the book “Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus”? The entire premise is that there are undeniable differences between men and women. And while I’m no relationship counselor, I actually think J and I are pretty similar, similar values, similar thought processes, similar jobs. But the one thing we don’t have in common is that J doesn’t really like sugary sweets. And I crave them all the time.</p>

<p>Once I have one sugary treat, I slowly convince myself I should have another, and maybe another, and just one more. Honestly, I envy those who assert moderation with froyo, cookies, pancakes, etc. It isn’t something I think I’ll ever be able to do. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-FjdAIQNBw2Y/VLdRgvbZv-I/AAAAAAAATkw/Djxd6uO9Giw/w537-h716-no/15%2B-%2B1" alt=""><div class="caption">This wasn’t the only cookie.</div></p>

<p>And I get into this mindset that whenever I do something difficult, or stressful, or even mildly praiseworthy, I deserve a treat. Or that because my coworkers are having dessert after a meal, I too should be able to have a cupcake, cookie or froyo after every lunch like they do.</p>

<p>My goal for January, and the subsequent months, is to only have dessert when it’s something monumental. For example. Fro-yo at work? Not really a treat. It’s available every day, if I don’t have some today, I can come back and have some tomorrow. But macarons from Paris, a cake baked by a good friend for a wedding, or even a few bites of chocolate with wine while in Napa. Totally worth it.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/UYdzEpHjAl04ZJxIj7uBd79wukl8eHNIOdMK2h5DOxDA=w1041-h656-no" alt=""><div class="caption">I can’t decide whether I’m more sad, or impressed that I was able to make a froyo collage</div></p>

<p>There’s a lot of temptation, the same place I brew tea, grab water, or snag an orange also has fishbowls full of M&amp;Ms, Reeses, and more. And every meal at work has dessert alongside it. But having an easy rule, makes it easier to ignore.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/YwHpMLh6wcWef9Mh2pqBPhrMosInm-U2j8zcSu7CDYbc=w1041-h680-no" alt=""><div class="caption">There&#39;s even one of these filled with Justin&#39;s Nut Butters. How can I resist?</div></p>

<p>Because dessert isn’t something I’m owed. By eating my lunch, I didn’t do anything candy, cookie, cake-worthy. And, regardless, food shouldn’t be the primary way I reward myself.</p>

<p>I know some people love moderation, and I’m a big fan of you doing whatever works for you. One day, I hope to get to a place where I can practice moderation without finishing an entire pan of brownies in one sitting. :) But until then, I need to be a little stricter with myself.</p>

<p>Do you have food “rules”? Is there anything you won’t eat?</p>

	<h1><a href="/1-14-2015/WIAW.html">WIAW - Craving's ahoy</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		January 14, 2015
	</div>

	<p>This <a href="http://peasandcrayons.com/2015/01/ate-wednesday-208.html">Wednesday</a> was brought to you by my cravings. It was a day I ate the things I was hungry for. Which worked out pretty well overall.</p>

<p>In the next few WIAW, I think I might experiment spending a day eating other popular diets. While I like the way I eat now, I think it might be fun to shake things up in the New Year. My work offers a lot of flexibility when it comes to vegan, paleo, raw, gluten free, etc diets, and while I have the chance I should try it.</p>

<p>The day started with a pretty standard cup of steel cut oats, I added, raisins, coconut, peanut butter, and a little bit of ground flax and cinnamon. Delicious, once I stirred it all together. But needed more protein. I was ravenous by lunch!</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-aTCM_ILWK-Q/VLVKMHgp9hI/AAAAAAAATdk/waIBUaoWuS4/w955-h716-no/IMG_6045.JPG" alt="breakfast"></p>

<p>Lunch was slightly large. I had both a grilled chicken sandwich, and vegan broccoli-kale soup. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-lmH2PkbQ4qs/VLX0ajAjIJI/AAAAAAAATdM/rzSylSquBes/w973-h716-no/IMG_6053.JPG" alt="lunch"></p>

<p>I was looking forward to the chicken when I ordered it, but I have to say, this soup was the star. Packed with vegetables, and a smooth consistency, you can bet I’m ordering this guy again.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-1t3kEu1EU2U/VLX0eSO86kI/AAAAAAAATdU/VXcJ3uOR4Wo/w948-h716-no/IMG_6055.JPG" alt="lunch soup"></p>

<p>So many snacks today! I’ve been eating my weight in satsuma mandarins lately. They are delicious. I had one with a little bag of pistachios. (Small win, this is the first bag of pistachios where I’ve been able to unshell every single one!)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-j3Uf0qpReQs/VLVYFbmw8PI/AAAAAAAATd4/uFwz4jqyQFU/w955-h716-no/IMG_6049.JPG" alt="snack nuts and orange"></p>

<p>And a little square of cheese. I love cheese, and have split entire cheese plates with others before. I’m always a little sad when I realize this is the serving size.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-xWdbSCPOF9o/VLX0gc8k4II/AAAAAAAATeA/loYxSCAkuAA/w715-h716-no/IMG_6056.JPG" alt="snack cheese"></p>

<p>Old habits die hard. Also I had a really long yoga class that stretched past dinner. So when I biked home at 8 pm, I didn’t really want to do more than put a pot of popcorn on the stove.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/AGD2fVv4LCD-IpOliBHLiZ5IRirjuFlzDY-fkOidK5-o=w955-h716-no" alt="Dinner popcorn"></p>

<p>Also unpictured, a cookies and cream quest bar. But! I kind of hated this. Did I eat this wrong? It was kind of slimy and the only redeeming quality was the cookie portion of this guy. I’ve heard people microwave and broil these, does that make it better?</p>

<p>What’s the best thing you ate all day? the worst? How do you eat a quest bar (if you eat them)?</p>

	<h1><a href="/1-12-2015/aspen-glow.html">Aspen Glow, Weekend Recap</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		January 12, 2015
	</div>

	<p>It’s one of those Mondays, where I can’t believe it’s Monday already. I think it has a little something to do with the fact that I spent my entire weekend here:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-0gC_Qyb39hc/VLN6g-9adpI/AAAAAAAATXc/co52EKkcLns/w864-h531-no/IMG_6019.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Time flies a lot faster on a mountain.</p>

<p>J and I spent the weekend in Tahoe with fifteen of our friends. We rented a cabin, bought an unwieldy amount of food from Costco, and skied our hearts out. J, my ever patient boyfriend and ex-ski-instructor, spent most of his time trying to teach me how to come down a mountain without dying. </p>

<p>I mostly succeeded.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Oh_vdfMVi6c/VLHAK2kIqxI/AAAAAAAATXs/pAiXHmIMNS4/w864-h648-no/IMG_6012.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>It was my second time skiing. Even though I didn’t make it to the blue runs, (in fact, I kind of freaked out about the one I did), I had a blast. </p>

<p>While I think taking lessons from someone close to you can be a disaster, I learned really well from J, and didn’t kill him (neither death by ski crash, nor death from over critiquing my form). Which is pretty much a relationship win in my book.</p>

<p>Even with 15 people, the cabin went smoothly, we didn’t trash the place, get too drunk, and we didn’t cook all our breakfast bacon at 3 am. Which the group took as a positive sign we’re getting older. We all returned home safely, and to the most beautiful sunset I’ve seen ever.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Pj2BErvuo8c/VLN68DeKXAI/AAAAAAAATXU/4pXfZZjVViE/w863-h358-no/IMG_6039.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Today, I’m pretty much sore everywhere, and I feel really energized. Which is a pretty great excuse to spend a weekend doing something new. I’ll definitely be skiing again soon. :)</p>

<p>How was your weekend?   </p>

	<h1><a href="/1-9-2015/happenings.html">Preweekend Happenings</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		January 9, 2015
	</div>

	<p>This whole week I’ve felt under the weather. I’m pretty sure this is what happens when you start feeding your body actual nutrients after a two week diet of sugar and alcohol. </p>

<p>I’ve been taking it easy, a lot of my coworkers have been out sick, and I&#39;d hate to make it worse. But my body really did me in this time, because while I was chilling at home in a shark onesie, trying to figure out what my stomach would consider eating.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-popriW-o1rA/VH6hu6tBwzI/AAAAAAAATGw/KcQDZigrIpQ/w537-h716-no/IMG_5015.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>My boyfriend was meeting Chris Hemsworth (who he keeps adorably referring to as Liam.) I got this Snapchat as I was laying on the couch, wishing I could surgically remove my intestines.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/NqGzdOomSihcELoqn6MQiptlK2A76QbaXMU5n4aA2V1U=w403-h715-no" alt=""></p>

<p>I’m feeling better today, but that’s not the point! I could have been there if it wasn&#39;t for my scumbag stomach. :)</p>

<p>I saw this candle on someone’s blog this week (sorry I forgot who, my memory is terrible). And because I’m an impulsive child, I bought it Thursday night. </p>

<p>Big surprise. It smells like cotton candy, or just straight up sugar, or some saccharine sweet smell you know immediately. And while it’s not the candle I’ll use to seduce my boyfriend into a romantic night (unless your boyfriend loves candy, then this IS your candle), it’s a fun scent to have burning.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/WsK-aKJupQyVZ-mLUWnAQTNBMrcdR3EtpWQYopftPZAt=w781-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>And while I’m not usually a food candle person, I’m glad I grabbed this baby at Target. For 10 dollars we can make my house smell like all the best parts of a carnival. :)</p>

<p>Finally, I took this picture covertly at work of our fruit situation. Is it just me, or does fruit seem more legit when it still has the leaves on it? I keep picking the mandarins that look like they’re still growing on a tree somewhere.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/u_tS1bNtXP4S3y8B1bQmBr5NSX4SoAu3B-QIxoG_xcD6=w1041-h713-no" alt=""></p>

<p>I hoard like 3 of those puppies a day. Don’t judge.</p>

<p>Anyhow! I&#39;m off skiing this weekend. This is the second time in my life ever, and J&#39;s like 3409803945 time. He was an instructor for a brief period of time, so I try to use him for lessons to save money. :)</p>

<p>What are you up to this weekend?</p>
