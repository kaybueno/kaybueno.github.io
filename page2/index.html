	<p>Chicago was a whirlwind of food, fun, family and friends, but mostly food. I spent 14 days catching up, baking, and reminding myself exactly how much I hate winter.</p>

<p>I had an amazing time, whether it was schooling my brother’s girlfriend at Mario Party, shopping with my mom at Lululemon, or hanging out with every single person I loved in college. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-cZ0UT1QCpuc/VKVndNKlfvI/AAAAAAAASio/tG9vyyBIBO0/w896-h672-no/IMG_5827.JPG" alt="city bean"></p>

<p>It was cold, and my family had anywhere from 6-8 people crashing in a 3 bedroom home. Which meant we all had a little bit of cabin fever, and were a little bit too friendly. One day, after we were sick of our laptops, I let C cornrow my hair. </p>

<p>While the cornrows turned out nice, and eventually ended up in cute curls. It was a painful, crazy idea. :)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/hma3Msu2xOkkAYXyNwt00ZwjoRcrfINNA8cX3FM_E6Lo=w753-h672-no" alt="hair braiding"></p>

<p>J visited for a few days, prior to vacationing with his roommate in Mexico. (And only packed one bag for both trips. Crazy!). We dragged him to our favorite, locally made, ice cream spot. He was excited but very very cold.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/xDFQZ4uyuLzQo0aPoq0eymWeYYfsNeHlm4q4561yOw5X=w670-h672-no" alt="J eating ice cream"></p>

<p>One of my Christmas gifts was a croissant baking class at Sur la Table. It was basically magical because you didn’t have to do any cleaning, and I got to eat a lot of warm croissants. I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ll ever make a croissant like the ones in Paris, or even the ones at Tartine in San Francisco. But I definitely upped my bread game.</p>

<p>I make a lot of faces while baking.</p>

<p>On Christmas, my family does fondue. Cheese, meat, and chocolate. It’s delicious. But my sister always ends up outeating everyone when it comes to the beef. So much this year, that I called her Edward Steakerhands.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-MEnkX1baILraYEsgCDaXL39aTOsuKlX3l5opvKF7Pgz=s672-no" alt="fondue"></p>

<p>Posting this makes me miss Chicago already. :)</p>

<p>How were your holidays? Are you getting back into schedule?</p>

	</div>
	<p>Happy New Year! I’ve been busy spending time with family and friends, but wanted to get back to blogging for the kickoff of 2015.</p>

<p>Even J made it out here to spend time in Chicago. :)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-c9ngGjnnnw8/VKVnKn01UVI/AAAAAAAAShI/eaFTzZ8myE0/w955-h716-no/IMG_5819.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>A lot of people aren’t fans of resolutions. Gyms fill up for a few weeks. No one wants to go out to eat. Everyone’s telling you what they’ll do differently this year from last year from the year before that.</p>

<p>But I love resolutions. I adore planning, and after working on a team that does quarterly planning, and weekly check ins. I don’t think you can accurately capture all the things you want to do without written goals.  </p>

<h2><strong>Fitness:</strong></h2>

<p><strong>10 pushups.</strong> This is so pathetic. But. I remember easily pumping out push ups in school, and now I can barely handle one.</p>

<p><strong>1 pull up.</strong> Such a stretch goal. I will literally throw a party, a physical party, if I can do a pull up unassisted.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-m2mOoRn1tSI/VGrZn8m2nlI/AAAAAAAAO3c/cS96NlCK_jQ/w477-h716-no/bazu-3697090.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>The splits.</strong> I offered all the members of my family 100 dollars if they could do one at any point by the end of 2015.</p>

<p>There are notoriously no running goals in here, because I have a few events planned, and I’m not really stressing right now about my speed.</p>

<h2>Blog:</h2>

<p><strong>Blog more regularly.</strong> Perhaps with a schedule. Right now I’m kinda just doing whatever I want. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Zr8h4rbF_K8/VGBHjDUlpQI/AAAAAAAAN1w/pv4jcBm7KZY/w955-h716-no/IMG_4454.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>Hit up more bloggers in real life.</strong> I love the bloggers I’ve met, and I’d only like to meet more. I tend to travel a good bit during the year, and having gone to a small college, I never have people to meet up in popular cities. </p>

<h2>Life:</h2>

<p><strong>Get ready for bed every night at 11 pm.</strong> This doesn’t mean go to bed at 11, this means, get ready for bed at 11.</p>

<p><strong>Cook once a month.</strong> (I know, hella pathetic) But! Work basically dictates that I never have to cook. But I’m worried if I ever leave the comfort of a large tech company, I’ll be living off Chipotle and toast (not entirely a bad thing)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/JihbdlXE54GXGLFkj-wzlKfFc0qGgLldxsXEFWgZSwrA=w597-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>Put down the screens ~30 minutes before bed.</strong> I’m so attached to my computer, phone, tablet, etc, that I need to spend 30 minutes knitting, reading a book, or just cuddling up before sleeping.</p>

<h2>Friends:</h2>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-MnM_PJe9Q5M/U9p-RxnW4EI/AAAAAAAABHs/_uCH0cN8HnI/w480-h640-no/IMG_0204.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>Write letters!</strong> I just got some really adorable wax and wax stamps as a gift from my mother for Christmas. I’d like to keep in touch with more people, and write and send physical letters. That said, if you ever want some real mail. Email me so I can send some! (I know. Ironic) </p>

<p><strong>Keep in touch better with friends from home.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Take a girls’ trip.</strong> I have spent a lot of time traveling and vacationing with J. And while I want to keep doing that, I want to do at least one girls’ vacay this year.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-zoB25pts1Ik/VEMCBYO1OKI/AAAAAAAAMCY/bel2wDqnmB8/w955-h716-no/IMG_3922.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>I’d go with anyone if we ended up here. :)</p>

<p>More than making goals, I believe checking in on goals is important. So I’ve put 3 month check-ins on my calendar (March 29, June 28, Sept 27, and Dec 31), to let you and myself know how I’m progressing.</p>

<p>How do you feel about resolutions? What are your goals for this year? </p>

	<p>Good morning! (Or really, whenever you happen to be reading this). Usually, on Wednesdays, I break down all the delicious things I eat for <a href="http://peasandcrayons.com/2014/12/merry-christmahanukwanzaakah-wiaw-205-2.html">WIAW</a>. And today isn’t any different, except that, this morning, we had our big family Christmas.</p>

<p>So this late blog, is brought to you by sugar-cookie, animal-shaped waffles. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-dGBlwomLlIc/VJsKKdOmRLI/AAAAAAAASJk/zjshDFpz-Mk/w896-h672-no/wafflecollage.png" alt="Waffles"></p>

<p>I’ve been home, in Chicago for the week, so aside from the time change, the weather change, and the change in scenery, my eating schedule also feels wonky. Lunch and dinner feel too early, all the food tastes different, etc. By Wednesday, I was kind of craving my normal.</p>

<p>One of the great things about having homogenous work offices is it’s easy to get similar food everywhere. So after the serious cookie overload, I was ready to get something a little healthier in me.</p>

<p>I started with fruit and a biscotti. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/TqRyscLqsRDqSU7ALcZdxwF6gmaetqfPRyOlLRufr8_h=w973-h716-no" alt="Breakfast"></p>

<p>Lunch was a salad with pico de gallo, corn, olives, and root vegetable puree, carrot ginger soup, and a cut of arctic char (Which I found out, after watching Alton Brown on the plane for 5 hours, is a close relative of both salmon, and trout, aka delicious).</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-SLtaXMmflME/VJhprozEsDI/AAAAAAAARzM/GIkJ_mHWNio/w1041-h599-no/IMG_5578.JPG" alt="Lunch"></p>

<p>Mid-day, the chef team put out vats of hot chocolate. Who was I to say no? </p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Q-AtKJkaJ5zaBuMOsJ_Lvxp643pjACsSExKy3DUVPpIn=w616-h716-no" alt="Hot chocolate snack"></p>

<p>I actually didn’t end up finishing it all, and when I washed out my cup, found a layer of sprinkles caked onto the bottom. Can we say, addiction?</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-g6-NmHLdqHs/VJsIl4H3XbI/AAAAAAAASJY/YuexHojVwYI/s672-no/IMG_5697.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>When I got home I had a tea and some sugar cookies. Not like I was ever going to escape those. I think every day of the holidays should include some amount of cookies. 
Not pictured are the copious cups of coffee I’ve been drinking, and the small mountain of other sweets I’ve been enjoying since everyone is in a baking mood.</p>

<p>A merry, merry Christmas to those who celebrate it! I hope you all get wonderful gifts tomorrow, and stay close to family. While I rocked the gift giving and receiving today, tomorrow I get the best gift ever, because J lands in Chicago to spend the week with me. :)</p>

<p>What are you hoping to receive? What’s the best gift you’re giving? Have you eaten as much delicious food as I have recently?</p>

	<h1><a href="/12-22-2014/holiday-cookie-baking.html">Weekend Recap - Family Baking Time</a></h1>

	<p>Greetings from Chicago. I’m finally home for the holidays. </p>

<p>Do you ever have really terrible ideas you don’t realize are terrible until after you’re stuck? Welcome to me, with my flight home. For some reason, I thought it was a great idea to go with the cheapest Southwest one I could find. Which meant on Saturday, I was on a plane from 2:00pm-8:30pm. Total day killer.</p>

<p>I made up for my Saturday’s transgressions by spending time with family. I did some last minute shopping, and came across this train. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-mOyMJNq6oEg/VJeI4In2bkI/AAAAAAAARvM/TGSSp70rkVM/w593-h716-no/IMG_5489.JPG" alt="kay in train"></p>

<p>I wouldn’t have even noticed the train, or sat in it, or even posted about it, if it didn’t have a very very angry sign.</p>

<p>The sign said, and I quote “CHILDREN ONLY IN SEAT. NO CLIMBING OR HANGING. DO NOT DAMAGE. VIDEO MONITORING PRESENT!!!”</p>

<p>Post shopping, all the girls in the family (and my surprisingly-jaunty-after-getting-his-intestines-removed brother.) got together to bake and decorate cookies.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-nTZomQUI-qc/VJhSN1L1XjI/AAAAAAAARw4/CoIs0vbz_EM/w896-h672-no/cookiecollage.png" alt="cookie making"></p>

<p>The women in my family have been baking cookies since I was 4. Each year we end up taking on more and more cookies varieties (fortunately, we keep adding women to the family, by love or by birth). </p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/FbiuN6F-wgkBHZsQPPWa27A9pTzo2xL_wOf69t5pEeET=w586-h716-no" alt="The cookie table"> </p>

<p>Everyone’s cookies represent their individual baking, decorating or eating style. My youngest cousin topped everything in sprinkles, I used a small star point to fill my cookies, and my grandma dipped everything in chocolate. </p>

<p>Notable cookies are the “Pokeball” sugar cookie, and the “I will kill u” star. We’re not murderers here, it’s just that my brother is very allergic to red dye, and so my sister (who has a mean hand with a piping bag) always makes a few sarcastic cookies.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/FzE2HOdWqq9znzkRJhaqvaz7fluACFlrgRbGvHyZgqJ9=w896-h672-no" alt="i will kill u"></p>

<p>After 5 hours of flour, sugar, butter, and love. We finally finished and took a quick photo of the gang. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-5z031tOPR-U/VJePlVNXwLI/AAAAAAAARts/_OmUO5o7uEs/w955-h716-no/IMG_5567.JPG" alt="Candid family photo"></p>

<p>It’s memories like these that you don’t forget. Partially because it’s so much fun, and partially because that red frosting is never coming out of the carpet.</p>

<p>What does your family do for the holidays? Do you have a “signature” cookie?</p>
