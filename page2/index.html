	<p>Two years ago. I didn’t have any hobbies. None. Not because I was busy, or because I had just moved, but because I couldn’t stomach the fact that I might look dumb doing something. </p>

<p>I was incredibly insecure. I thought that I needed to look effortless, and attractive, and cool, all the time. And that meant not taking on anything new, because I wasn&#39;t sure I could do it perfectly. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/8IbkLAUgzB56G4c9PAqYeZOxeBnXrUFXAdN-UzBjFVIN=w794-h706-no" alt="dranks with the roomies"></p>

<p>(This is probably what I thought cool looked like.)</p>

<p>In the event I did end up out of my comfort zone, I wasn’t good at it, I’d just quit. I know, real winning attitude there. It was terrible for me, and probably worse for the people I was around. </p>

<p>And I might not have ever really tried anything if I didn’t accidentally stumble upon a hobby I loved.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Z8yQO85-AX8/VK4VSw64e0I/AAAAAAAATA0/EwLzC8jKEi8/w960-h637-no/trapeze1.jpg" alt="trapeze"></p>

<p>Flying trapeze. </p>

<p>I finally wanted to be good at something so badly, I was willing to be bad at it to do so. Flying trapeze was the greatest high (literally) I had ever had, and I was addicted. I was also terrible. I&#39;m inflexible, and tall, and altogether difficult person to catch. But it was amazing. And being bad at trapeze was the best thing that happened to me.</p>

<p>I figured, once I was a total novice at one thing. Why not make a fool of myself doing all the things I wished I could do?</p>

<p>So I started running. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/q250TjR-a9ZNhekEpN1N6TxDN3MUUNFaQ__vIcC4hwqA=w955-h716-no" alt="running"></p>

<p>And yoga.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/KIMoLaHs688VGrCvkLkCL9w6CLFj_7Sayvbhyb3OWGV7=w932-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Today. Am I the best at any of these things? </p>

<p>Not even close. I run 9-10 minute miles, I&#39;m just now able to touch the floor in a forward fold, and I&#39;m still the slowest trapeze student to pick up new tricks. I read the most amazing blogs of friends who are spin instructors, serious yogis, competitive runners, and I think &quot;Oh god, what am I doing here?&quot;</p>

<p>But even as an inflexible, kind of slow student, I&#39;m the happiest me I&#39;ve ever been. I&#39;ve stopped comparing myself to others. I&#39;m much better at celebrating achievements, and I let myself try anything.</p>

<p>With the New Year rolling around, and goals being on everyone&#39;s mind, I want to remind you that you are more than the things you&#39;re good at, and it&#39;s worth trying anything you want to do even if you fail fantastically at it. I would have never run a half, or swung tricks out of lines if I didn&#39;t allow myself to be bad at things first.</p>

<p>In the immortal words of the cartoon show Adventure Time:</p>

<p>“Dude, suckin’ at something is the first step to being sorta good at something”.</p>

<p>What do you suck at?</p>

	<p>Guys. I don’t want to jinx it. But, the new year has me motivated. Real motivated. Like, spend-two-hours-power-cleaning-your-apartment-when-you-get-home-from-work motivated. </p>

<p>And it’s been spilling over evvvverywhere. One of the things I knew I needed to rock in January was my eating habits, especially important after I consumed no less than 23495 Christmas cookies while home last week.</p>

<p>So I’m trying to rock way more vegetables, way less sugar, and just a generally healthier eating schedule. So welcome to my favorite day of the week, <a href="http://peasandcrayons.com/2015/01/ate-wednesday-207.html">WIAW</a>.</p>

<p>Breakfast is standard. Greek yogurt, so much coffee, and asian pears.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-34vH2atyNig/VKwwq9zXEEI/AAAAAAAAS6U/V1WQzZxeQgg/w915-h912-no/IMG_5924.JPG" alt="Breakfast"></p>

<p>Welcome to “put your lunch over a salad” salad. One of my good friends in Chicago used to be a chef in a fancy Vegas restaurant, and when I told him about this food strategy, he threatened to disown me. Apparently, greens don’t automatically pair well with “everything”.</p>

<p>So this is shredded pork, guacamole, jalapenos, pico de gallo, over a salad. I couldn’t decide between the salsa roja, or the yogurt based salsa demente, so I used both. :)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ChUEd77bnX0/VKxjoXi4s7I/AAAAAAAAS9o/zDJxTCxy-VM/w915-h708-no/IMG_5928.JPG" alt="Lunch"></p>

<p>Snack was an old favorite. Popcorn, which I grabbed a handful or two and put into a vintage Santa mug. I’d like to say it’s because I still have a lot of Christmas spirit, but really it’s because I’m too lazy to put away my decorations.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-b6qoUn8hyRM/VKxkINWrasI/AAAAAAAAS9w/WRMWTLOuAac/w915-h985-no/IMG_5937.JPG" alt="Popcorn"></p>

<p>This is the post where you find out my hands are literally like paddles, or giant oven mitts. But I grabbed a handful of nuts. Best part? NO PEANUTS. I hate nut mixes that are dominated by peanuts. Put them in a nut butter, great. Put them in a trail mix and I’m over it. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-fQwpnx64LRk/VKx3W5v5wgI/AAAAAAAAS-s/5FVfJcmwtLc/w915-h1029-no/IMG_5939.JPG" alt="Nuts"></p>

<p>I had a grand total of three of these parmesan crisps (15 is a serving). But they were so delicious and satiating that I needed to include them. So enjoy the speckled brown that is my dirt floor, and do yourself a favor (if you like dairy) and get on these, or make them.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/J30cWAq9evBae1McsNtRkW3QJhxAGwzlcf1SHJ7kA78l=w915-h1046-no" alt="Parm Crisps"></p>

<p>Usually, I’m not much for dinner. But I’m trying to rectify that, and realize that popcorn is not a vegetable. So here’s salad part two. I try to relish in the fact that by eating this salad I’m now ahead of <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/wk/mm5935.pdf">75% of Americans in vegetable eating</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ZFOJvOFFc5Nhj83TxRByp9k-nWfMsJHfEJ-Gd7Eusf-d=w728-h716-no" alt="Dinner Salad"></p>

<p>Last, unrelated little tidbit. Today is the best Wednesday regardless of what I ate because it’s my mom’s birthday! Even though I hopefully already texted and called her, I want to wish her a third, or fourth Happy Birthday. </p>

<p>She’s not only had to put up with me for over 20 years, but she’s down for anything, we’ve done flying trapeze, surfed, and this year we’re running Seawheeze together.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-wk05N2A9x-w/VKzTfe5LccI/AAAAAAAATAQ/3BURMU1W6KM/w960-h640-no/momsurf.jpg" alt="Mom surfing"></p>

<p>So Happy Birthday Madre!</p>

<p>How’s your Wednesday going? </p>

	<p>Chicago was a whirlwind of food, fun, family and friends, but mostly food. I spent 14 days catching up, baking, and reminding myself exactly how much I hate winter.</p>

<p>I had an amazing time, whether it was schooling my brother’s girlfriend at Mario Party, shopping with my mom at Lululemon, or hanging out with every single person I loved in college. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-cZ0UT1QCpuc/VKVndNKlfvI/AAAAAAAASio/tG9vyyBIBO0/w896-h672-no/IMG_5827.JPG" alt="city bean"></p>

<p>It was cold, and my family had anywhere from 6-8 people crashing in a 3 bedroom home. Which meant we all had a little bit of cabin fever, and were a little bit too friendly. One day, after we were sick of our laptops, I let C cornrow my hair. </p>

<p>While the cornrows turned out nice, and eventually ended up in cute curls. It was a painful, crazy idea. :)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/hma3Msu2xOkkAYXyNwt00ZwjoRcrfINNA8cX3FM_E6Lo=w753-h672-no" alt="hair braiding"></p>

<p>J visited for a few days, prior to vacationing with his roommate in Mexico. (And only packed one bag for both trips. Crazy!). We dragged him to our favorite, locally made, ice cream spot. He was excited but very very cold.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/xDFQZ4uyuLzQo0aPoq0eymWeYYfsNeHlm4q4561yOw5X=w670-h672-no" alt="J eating ice cream"></p>

<p>One of my Christmas gifts was a croissant baking class at Sur la Table. It was basically magical because you didn’t have to do any cleaning, and I got to eat a lot of warm croissants. I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ll ever make a croissant like the ones in Paris, or even the ones at Tartine in San Francisco. But I definitely upped my bread game.</p>

<p>I make a lot of faces while baking.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/osrWLz6d8uAz6YCYd9l5KhtmwzcKsX2IKO1UZyxFd7ow=w662-h672-no" alt=""></p>

<p>On Christmas, my family does fondue. Cheese, meat, and chocolate. It’s delicious. But my sister always ends up outeating everyone when it comes to the beef. So much this year, that I called her Edward Steakerhands.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-MEnkX1baILraYEsgCDaXL39aTOsuKlX3l5opvKF7Pgz=s672-no" alt="fondue"></p>

<p>Posting this makes me miss Chicago already. :)</p>

<p>How were your holidays? Are you getting back into schedule?</p>

	<p>Happy New Year! I’ve been busy spending time with family and friends, but wanted to get back to blogging for the kickoff of 2015.</p>

<p>Even J made it out here to spend time in Chicago. :)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-c9ngGjnnnw8/VKVnKn01UVI/AAAAAAAAShI/eaFTzZ8myE0/w955-h716-no/IMG_5819.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>A lot of people aren’t fans of resolutions. Gyms fill up for a few weeks. No one wants to go out to eat. Everyone’s telling you what they’ll do differently this year from last year from the year before that.</p>

<p>But I love resolutions. I adore planning, and after working on a team that does quarterly planning, and weekly check ins. I don’t think you can accurately capture all the things you want to do without written goals.  </p>

<h2><strong>Fitness:</strong></h2>

<p><strong>10 pushups.</strong> This is so pathetic. But. I remember easily pumping out push ups in school, and now I can barely handle one.</p>

<p><strong>1 pull up.</strong> Such a stretch goal. I will literally throw a party, a physical party, if I can do a pull up unassisted.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-m2mOoRn1tSI/VGrZn8m2nlI/AAAAAAAAO3c/cS96NlCK_jQ/w477-h716-no/bazu-3697090.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>The splits.</strong> I offered all the members of my family 100 dollars if they could do one at any point by the end of 2015.</p>

<p>There are notoriously no running goals in here, because I have a few events planned, and I’m not really stressing right now about my speed.</p>

<h2>Blog:</h2>

<p><strong>Blog more regularly.</strong> Perhaps with a schedule. Right now I’m kinda just doing whatever I want. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Zr8h4rbF_K8/VGBHjDUlpQI/AAAAAAAAN1w/pv4jcBm7KZY/w955-h716-no/IMG_4454.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>Hit up more bloggers in real life.</strong> I love the bloggers I’ve met, and I’d only like to meet more. I tend to travel a good bit during the year, and having gone to a small college, I never have people to meet up in popular cities. </p>

<h2>Life:</h2>

<p><strong>Get ready for bed every night at 11 pm.</strong> This doesn’t mean go to bed at 11, this means, get ready for bed at 11.</p>

<p><strong>Cook once a month.</strong> (I know, hella pathetic) But! Work basically dictates that I never have to cook. But I’m worried if I ever leave the comfort of a large tech company, I’ll be living off Chipotle and toast (not entirely a bad thing)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/JihbdlXE54GXGLFkj-wzlKfFc0qGgLldxsXEFWgZSwrA=w597-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>Put down the screens ~30 minutes before bed.</strong> I’m so attached to my computer, phone, tablet, etc, that I need to spend 30 minutes knitting, reading a book, or just cuddling up before sleeping.</p>

<h2>Friends:</h2>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-MnM_PJe9Q5M/U9p-RxnW4EI/AAAAAAAABHs/_uCH0cN8HnI/w480-h640-no/IMG_0204.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>Write letters!</strong> I just got some really adorable wax and wax stamps as a gift from my mother for Christmas. I’d like to keep in touch with more people, and write and send physical letters. That said, if you ever want some real mail. Email me so I can send some! (I know. Ironic) </p>

<p><strong>Keep in touch better with friends from home.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Take a girls’ trip.</strong> I have spent a lot of time traveling and vacationing with J. And while I want to keep doing that, I want to do at least one girls’ vacay this year.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-zoB25pts1Ik/VEMCBYO1OKI/AAAAAAAAMCY/bel2wDqnmB8/w955-h716-no/IMG_3922.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>I’d go with anyone if we ended up here. :)</p>

<p>More than making goals, I believe checking in on goals is important. So I’ve put 3 month check-ins on my calendar (March 29, June 28, Sept 27, and Dec 31), to let you and myself know how I’m progressing.</p>

<p>How do you feel about resolutions? What are your goals for this year? </p>
