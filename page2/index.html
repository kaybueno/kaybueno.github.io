	<h1><a href="/2-19-2015/thinking-out-loud.html">Thinking Out Loud - What to do when the boyfriend’s away?</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		February 19, 2015
	</div>

	<p>J is leaving this morning on a round the world (okay, round the Europe) tour for work, which means I’m boyfriend-less for 18 days. While I’m sad (no cuddling for 18 days!) I’ve also been trying to think about, plan and fit in all the things that are better J-less:</p>

<p><strong>- Eating a lot of healthy and/or vegan food.</strong><br>
J is one of those people who, whenever a recipe says “Your boyfriend/friends/whatever won’t be able to tell the difference from the real thing” I know the recipe writer hasn’t met my boyfriend. He’s not easily swayed by black bean brownies, or tofu mousse. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-xtckJoAjNhc/VMXtbycCoKI/AAAAAAAAUcY/pUCfBCa8eTo/s716-no/IMG_6355.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>- Going to bed at 10 pm.</strong><br>
J and I have a sweet bedtime compromise. I’d love to go to sleep at 10 p.m. and wake up at 6 a.m.. And J would love to rock a 3 a.m. to noon type schedule. So usually we fall asleep between 11 p.m. and 12 a.m. and get up between 8-9 a.m. While J’s away, my bedtime is going to be grandma level.</p>

<p><strong>- Hit up some new exercise classes.</strong><br>
 Usually, J and I opt for hikes, or long bike rides when we’re together. But with him gone, I plan on trying some new things. Cardio barre, or contemporary dance anyone? :)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-H2XxbP4p3J8/VGAsgPYLe6I/AAAAAAAANy0/k86C2vFvROY/w955-h716-no/IMG_0469.JPG" alt=""><div class="caption">More surfset. Yes please!</div></p>

<p><strong>- Catching up on bad TV.</strong><br>
J is not a fan of the bachelor, or Scandal, or How to Get Away with Murder, or Are You the One? So while he’s gone I hope to binge on trashy wonderful TV. As long as it’s the only thing I binge on, I’ll consider it a win.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Jkyi2vHZ238/VGLUAF7AYEI/AAAAAAAAN_A/LirwvwjHfNs/s716-no/IMG_4463.JPG" alt=""><div class="caption">This bowl of popcorn is the only one who will watch Chris Soules with me.</div></p>

<p><strong>- Become a laundry tornado.</strong> 
Since we’ve just deep cleaned both our apartments, I’ve been trying to keep my clothes orderly. But left to my own devices, I am kind of a mess.</p>

<p>It’s good to get my <a href="http://www.runningwithspoons.com/2015/02/19/thinking-out-loud-118/">thoughts outloud</a>, and while I’m a little insecure about having a month without J around. (Am I destined to eat every meal alone? What happens if I lock myself out? etc) I’m hoping that by putting this out there, I get a lot done, rather than getting depressed and becoming a total recluse. </p>

	<div class="date">

	</div>

	<p>Hey all. Sorry I’ve been so MIA. I spent the weekend with my sister in Vegas watching the <a href="http://www.usasevens.com/las-vegas/">USA Rugby Sevens</a>. Embarrassingly, this international tournament is the first time I’ve actually watched rugby, despite the fact that my sister has played it for almost 4 years now. (Yes. I am really the worst.) But we had a lot of fun, the seats were amazing, and the games were great.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-mRRj5Oxx0-A/VOOE02-R8mI/AAAAAAAAXFA/JRHdyDpX5FE/w1041-h604-no/IMG_7191.JPG" alt="photo of me at the field"></p>

<p>For Christmas, I shelled out for seats right behind the try (the goal posts) and we watched with some of the biggest fans in Rugby. The row of gentlemen behind us were ex-pats from England, and I basically fell in love with them for their cheers. </p>

<p>If anything was good it was “Get it lads!” or if one of the England players missed a pass, “Oh what a muppet!” and when France played England I heard choruses of “The only reason France plays Rugby is for another excuse to wear Spandex.” or “No wonder France is trying Rugby, they don’t have anything they’re good at anymore now that California makes the best wines.” The kid sister and I couldn’t keep from cracking up.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-tNz7Zw-bI3M/VOOCxcGAijI/AAAAAAAAW6Q/6-yzouNKa5Y/w955-h716-no/IMG_7138.JPG" alt="photo of the sister at the field"><div class="caption">My sister and I look a lot alike.</div></p>

<p>We stayed at the team hotel, so we were constantly surrounded by giant rugby players. In the casino, at the bar, in the pool. It was a blast to feel like part of the team.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-br067BSLe6o/VOOE7Yl_DtI/AAAAAAAAXFU/Abyfizi486A/w537-h716-no/IMG_7197.JPG" alt="photo of drink at field"><div class="caption">The meaning of rugby. Alcohol and the Pitch.</div></p>

<p>We made our way around Vegas in the two days we had off.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-wTybrPrJGGk/VOODN4gI_oI/AAAAAAAAW9A/YnQkmI_ugSg/w953-h716-no/IMG_7053-MOTION.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>My suggestions? Drink all the novelty drinks. Explore all the stores. Walk the strip about 100 times. :)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-hbwqcV9d8K0/VON-_BJrWiI/AAAAAAAAWxg/meyPhQEFqgA/w537-h716-no/IMG_7046.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>My secret though? I’m terrible at Vegas. I’m not much for gambling, clubbing, smoking, or strippers. I like keeping my money, and that’s hard to do in Vegas. To be fair, we couldn’t stay out very late, because in order to get the best seats, we had to be at the field at 8 am. It was fun to visit for a weekend, but I would have been pretty bored if we were there much longer.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-aFt9ZSi-ylk/VON9c_IKZ3I/AAAAAAAAWp8/aXp9lnHa2G0/w955-h716-no/IMG_7005.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Have you been to Vegas before? What’s the most obscure sport you follow? </p>

<p><em>I’m catching up on all my blogs this week after having no service for five days. Sorry if I kill you with comments, likes, or love.</em></p>

	<h1><a href="/2-12-2015/sex-kitten-salad.html">Sex Kitten Salad: an early morning time saver.</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		February 12, 2015
	</div>

	<p>By the time you read this, I’ll already be on a 6 am flight to Vegas. My sister are headed out there to visit cupcake ATMs, walk the Strip, and most importantly watch the Rugby Sevens.</p>

<p>This week has been crazy, and SFO airport is honestly one of the saddest airports when it comes to food. More than that, I’ve always been one of those people who likes waking up early in the morning, but hates doing things early in the morning. Let’s be real, when I’m up at 5 am, my first thought isn’t what gourmet breakfast I’m going to cook.</p>

<p>Which is why, I’ve been making the Sex Kitten Salad, from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Skinny-Confidential-Health-Lifestyle/dp/1624140459">The Skinny Confidential’s new book</a>. (Ask me about all the recipes I’m trying from it!) I&#39;ve been following <a href="http://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/">Lauryn Evarts</a> for an embarrasssingly long amount of time, she opened me to the world of <a href="http://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/2014/04/23/shaving-face-but-women/">shaving your face</a>, makes me want to improve my <a href="http://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/2014/06/08/traveling-essentials-ramblings/">travel essentials</a>, and keeps me envying her killer style with her <a href="http://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/2011/10/22/mini-delites-5/">mini delites</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Ri1LVFeHB1M/VNxk40JJFKI/AAAAAAAAWbM/OzUZ1Xdy-do/w933-h716-no/15%2B-%2B2" alt=""></p>

<p>This simple fruit salad is easy to customize, develops even more flavor overnight, and can be made with things you likely even have in your fridge. And with the leftovers, you can rock some of The Skinny Confidential’s, <a href="http://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/2014/10/16/busy-deal-5-chia-seed-jam/">5 second chia seed jam</a>. (In blueberry instead of raspberry, natch).</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-4ZCQ1DeG4YY/VNxk4w-2L6I/AAAAAAAAWbA/8MFc1761Ix4/w504-h672-no/15%2B-%2B6" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>Serves 1.</strong> <em>(but you should make more, because trust me, everyone’s gonna want some)</em></p>

<p><strong>Ingredients</strong><br>
1 handful of strawberries, sliced<br>
1 handful of blueberries<br>
4 hefty pineapple wedges, chopped<br>
1 kiwi, skinned and diced<br>
4 tbsp/30 g Greek yogurt<br>
2 tbsp/20 g chia seeds  </p>

<p><strong>Spices</strong><br>
Cinnamon, to taste<br>
Pumpkin pie spice, to taste<br>
Nutmeg, to taste<br>
Optional: fresh mint leaves  </p>

<p><strong>Directions</strong> <em>(So basic, I shouldn&#39;t even have to tell you.)</em><br>
Combine all ingredients in a large bowl and toss lightly. Add extra spices on top. Garnish 
with mint (optional).</p>

<p>While I layered mine parfait style, I think this would look lovely served over yogurt in a glass bowl, or laid out by fruit type on a tray for brunch.</p>

<p>It’s been a welcome change from my bagged eggs for breakfast, and I might try it with coconut cream instead of yogurt for a paleo twist.</p>

<p>What’s your speed breakfast? How do you save time in the morning?</p>

<p><em>I was sent “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Skinny-Confidential-Health-Lifestyle/dp/1624140459">The Skinny Confidential: A Babe&#39;s Sexy, Sassy Health and Lifestyle Guide”</a> but, I’ve actually been eating my weight in this salad, so all opinions are my own.</em></p>

	<h1><a href="/2-11-2015/WIAW-intuitive-eating.html">WIAW, Intuitive Eating</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		February 11, 2015
	</div>

	<p>It’s one of those weeks where <a href="//www.peasandcrayons.com">Wednesday</a> feels like Friday. Probably because I’m hopping a plane to Vegas tomorrow. Intuitive eating was the perfect eating experience to try to embody on a day where I felt like I had to micromanage every other aspect of my life.</p>

<p>While actual intuitive eating has a lot of components, and is much more than a day’s effort, I wanted to see how I would do if I just let myself eat when I decided I needed to. Each thing I ate will talk about how I felt about eating it.</p>

<p>Breakfast started a little different. I had two cranberry vegan pancakes, and decidedly non-vegan eggs. I walked to work this morning, and as someone who experiences morning hunger without even moving, I was pretty hungry when I got in.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/zEN_PEetcHlawpimCKGbyl25zvvnwTHIdq7KdfIKJzca=w955-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>How I felt: I had just walked two miles to work, I probably should have waited 15 minutes for my stomach to settle a bit more before eating to better gauge my hunger.</p>

<p>Lunch I didn’t have a lot of choice in, my coworkers and I eat together every day around noon. So even though I started feeling a little hungry at 11:30, this was the one meal I couldn’t go intuitive on.</p>

<p>We stopped at a bbq food truck, where I grabbed flank steak, whole wheat pasta with tomato and spinach, and a whole bunch of roasted broccoli.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/VFMNH3dAP9dITlQQqXHahAv7tkaMEpCj5tWtU_RvwcZi=w966-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>How I felt: I was definitely ready to eat by the time this came around, and I felt pretty nourished by this plate. </p>

<p>I had ⅓ of an apple fritter. A coworker came around with treats for his birthday, and two of my teammates and I split one. There’s no picture because I stood in a huge group, drinking coffee and celebrating a friend’s achievements. Sometimes, you can’t always snap what you ate.</p>

<p>How I felt: This was celebration food. I definitely wasn’t hungry at this point, but I didn’t indulge in an entire dessert myself, and it was the right move.</p>

<p>I grabbed another snack later in the day. Work has been stocking these bars, and they’re pretty much like healthy candy. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-MQlh0FAWbFw/VNr4O_2LOrI/AAAAAAAAWQM/Rbi3PSW_uD4/w538-h716-no/15%2B-%2B1" alt=""></p>

<p>How I felt: Honestly. I think I just grabbed one of these to have an excuse to get up from my desk. I love these, but I wasn’t hungry when I ate it.</p>

<p>I went for a run, biked home, and then J and I spent the evening cleaning. At the end of the night after a bunch of sweat, bleach, and exhaustion, I just wasn’t hungry. I grabbed a handful of See’s Hot Hearts. (These are like the best Hot Tamales I’ve ever had, and cinnamon candy is difficult for me to go overboard on.)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/p786qXmuxPlSNHPNp_prnJA4qJCz2RB_lMWUjXDS6Mf3=s716-no" alt=""><div class="caption">Please enjoy my kitchen tile, straight from the 70s.</div> </p>

<p>How I felt: I probably didn’t need these, I was mostly tired, not very hungry.</p>

<p>I think I’m better at identifying food I am hungry for, and food I’m craving than I give myself credit for. I definitely ate a bunch of sugary things today, more than I usually shoot for, but overall it wasn’t terrible.</p>

<p>I’d love to eventually transition over to a more intuitive style of eating, but right now, I do live, and like living with some food rules. So we’ll see.</p>

<p>Do you eat intuitively? What’s the best thing you ate recently?</p>
