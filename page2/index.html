	<h1><a href="/2-23-2015/weekend-recap-walk-san-francisco.html">Weekend Recap - How I walked San Francisco</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		February 23, 2015
	</div>

	<p>Given the weather around the world, I feel a little guilty posting this weekend recap. My pictures will give away the temperature out in Northern California. It was around 65 degrees, and a hot 65 at that.</p>

<p>I want to tell you how beautiful it was to walk around all week, but given that everyone else I know has sidewalks covered in ice. I’ll let the pictures do the talking.</p>

<p>Saturday morning I headed down to the Embarcadero, to check out the farmers market. It’s in my opinion the best farmers market in the city, albeit a little crowded by 10 a.m. One of the big draws is the fact that they have multiple street food vendors, and so it’s a great place to come grab brunch, and some cheap, delicious fruit too.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Kzl8t_LfhtU/VOswC8bO4mI/AAAAAAAAXTk/YbpJgDyeZ0A/w1023-h767-no/IMG_7246.JPG" alt=""><div class="caption">Flowers from the farmers market</div></p>

<p>While I’m excited to have a lot of free time since J is gone for the next few weeks, I also was worried that that might manifest itself into me just hiding at home because “it’s not worth going out” or “I don’t want to eat alone” or “I don’t know what to do.” So one of my goals was to stay out of the house as much as possible. After leaving the farmers market I stopped for a tea at Starbucks (it was 8 a.m., and a little chilly for me)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-qmhguE_QIfY/VOsvvDsxz1I/AAAAAAAAXQ0/2x1UO5ksHZI/w1023-h1364-no/IMG_7231.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>I spent a lot of time walking around, perusing stores. Did you know San Francisco has a Neiman Marcus Last Call? It’s kind of like the Nordstrom’s Rack for Neiman Marcus, or the inbetween of store and outlet. It’s beautiful, has gorgeous designer gear, and ugh. I almost caved to a pair of Frye boots marked down from $430 to $185, but then I realized money doesn’t grow on trees.</p>

<p>Lunch was calling me, so I headed to Basik. Acai in San Francisco is a dangerous thing. I tried to go twice this weekend, it was sold out by noon on Sunday.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-0VyDXs7lTp4/VOswQOK8xjI/AAAAAAAAXV0/rILg88OT5eQ/s1023-no/IMG_7270.JPG" alt=""> </p>

<p>In the evening I met up with a friend to play bocce at a bar. I totally forgot that bocce is fun, and I was actually passably good at it. </p>

<p>Sunday morning I grabbed brunch with friends. I was so busy chatting I didn’t even remember to snap a picture. After hanging out with them for awhile, I went walking again. I actually ended up walking over 23 miles between Saturday and Sunday.</p>

<p>After a lot of walking, I was really feeling a smoothie, so I stopped at <a href="http://earthbar.com/">Earth Bar</a> and grabbed their Miami Beach. It was really light and refreshing, it’s made of Pineapple, Papaya, Banana, &amp; Coconut Water, so it was a nice way to rehydrate. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/P2HYvmPzZ4KdyfjCUjyERmw7zlu-WTul8ArTWJS4i_E0=w1023-h1364-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Later in the evening, I met up with <a href="http://almostgettingittogether.com/">Cassie</a> for my first ever SoulCycle class, found out I can sweat even more than I thought I could, and ate a great homemade dinner (thanks girl). </p>

<p>After a weekend like that, I don’t really want to go to work today. :)</p>

<p>How was your weekend? Did you try anything new?</p>

	<h1><a href="/2-20-2015/friday-faves-photo-editing.html">Friday Faves - iPhone Photo Editing</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		February 20, 2015
	</div>

	<p>I openly love to take in flight shots. Although, since I’m almost always leaving California, and flying east, they all have looked like that lately.</p>

<p>Speaking of photos, I wanted to chat about some of the photo editing stuff I love. I am admittedly, still strapped to my iPhone for most blog pictures. But why make a bad thing worse? </p>

<p>My most recent fave is definitely <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/darkroom-by-bergen/id953286746">Darkroom - photo editor</a> an app that mimics the best Lightroom features for your iPhone. Full disclosure, one of the founders is a friend. (However, I paid for the app, so.)</p>

<p>But believe you me, I’m not the only one who thinks it’s the best, it has <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/2/12/8025141/best-photo-editing-app-darkroom-iphone">rave</a> <a href="http://petapixel.com/2015/02/12/darkroom-ios-photo-editing-app-diy-filters-curves-infinite-history/">reviews</a> <a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/312063/darkroom-like-best-adobe-lightroom-iphone/">from</a> <a href="http://www.popphoto.com/news/2015/02/new-app-darkroom-photo-editor-ios">multiple</a> publications (including the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/19/technology/personaltech/tools-to-make-meetings-more-productive-and-maybe-more-pleasant.html?_r=0">NYTimes</a>) and appeared as one of Apple’s best new apps.</p>

<p>It looks something like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-_Aydp3Ebu04/VOdYO1bJEsI/AAAAAAAAXOM/UkRQ8jSFD40/w403-h715-no/IMG_7225.PNG" alt=""></p>

<p>And within each image you can adjust the curves, use filters, and more importantly create preset filters for yourself. I’ve heard, although I don’t know much, that it’s similar to vscocam, but more customization.</p>

<p>Both of the following images went through Darkroom.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/0IJFKvzTpF2GE3nDqwgHbLKjOilAxj8eA-kSpRazlZ7y=w1040-h703-no" alt=""></p>

<p>I’m not super knowledgeable about photo editing, but I’ve never had a moment using it where I felt like the unedited picture looked better.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/wjHypFFop_3I1GKYT89JAAwctFpZKjyr0lbK6qL0f8i5=w1039-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Additionally in the realm of photography, I back up all my phone pictures to Google+. This is two fold, one because I’m biased towards the Goog. But two, because I actually think account security, and photo editing are way better in G+. Aka. My photos aren’t going to be leaked in some celebrity nude-gate.</p>

<p>G+ has a feature called “Auto Awesome” which tries to analyze photos and figure out how to improve them. This can be anything from looking at a series of similar photos and building one where everyone is smiling, to making collages out of photos that historically go together. </p>

<p>A lot of time, computers and algorithms are naive, and so it’s often an “Auto Awful” more than an “Auto Awesome”. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-nw0ElTpK95E/VKVy6hhW2lI/AAAAAAAASvY/umP2RYhI4ns/w953-h716-no/IMG_5784-MOTION.gif" alt=""><div class="caption">More awful, or awesome?</div></p>

<p>But recently I got this gorgeous pano from my Vegas photos. It&#39;s a lot more striking larger, but I love good panoramas!</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-vau9-UTx6HI/VOOGQZsh8VI/AAAAAAAAXMM/8J4ZVfKrgkQ/w1041-h374-no/IMG_7140-PANO.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Last but not least. The cutest Valentines Day food ever. This guacamole. I didn’t spend good old V-day with J. (although he did get me the cutest card, and gifts). But at least I spent it with the next best thing. Avocados. (oh, and my sister).</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-vwD4wIZtXtw/VOOEpQnVo4I/AAAAAAAAXB0/IDWmP86cy8I/s672-no/IMG_7179.JPG" alt="valentines day guacamole"></p>

<p>What are your favorite things lately? Any photo tricks that you use? </p>

	<h1><a href="/2-19-2015/thinking-out-loud.html">Thinking Out Loud - What to do when the boyfriend’s away?</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		February 19, 2015
	</div>

	<p>J is leaving this morning on a round the world (okay, round the Europe) tour for work, which means I’m boyfriend-less for 18 days. While I’m sad (no cuddling for 18 days!) I’ve also been trying to think about, plan and fit in all the things that are better J-less:</p>

<p><strong>- Eating a lot of healthy and/or vegan food.</strong><br>
J is one of those people who, whenever a recipe says “Your boyfriend/friends/whatever won’t be able to tell the difference from the real thing” I know the recipe writer hasn’t met my boyfriend. He’s not easily swayed by black bean brownies, or tofu mousse. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-xtckJoAjNhc/VMXtbycCoKI/AAAAAAAAUcY/pUCfBCa8eTo/s716-no/IMG_6355.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>- Going to bed at 10 pm.</strong><br>
J and I have a sweet bedtime compromise. I’d love to go to sleep at 10 p.m. and wake up at 6 a.m.. And J would love to rock a 3 a.m. to noon type schedule. So usually we fall asleep between 11 p.m. and 12 a.m. and get up between 8-9 a.m. While J’s away, my bedtime is going to be grandma level.</p>

<p><strong>- Hit up some new exercise classes.</strong><br>
 Usually, J and I opt for hikes, or long bike rides when we’re together. But with him gone, I plan on trying some new things. Cardio barre, or contemporary dance anyone? :)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-H2XxbP4p3J8/VGAsgPYLe6I/AAAAAAAANy0/k86C2vFvROY/w955-h716-no/IMG_0469.JPG" alt=""><div class="caption">More surfset. Yes please!</div></p>

<p><strong>- Catching up on bad TV.</strong><br>
J is not a fan of the bachelor, or Scandal, or How to Get Away with Murder, or Are You the One? So while he’s gone I hope to binge on trashy wonderful TV. As long as it’s the only thing I binge on, I’ll consider it a win.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Jkyi2vHZ238/VGLUAF7AYEI/AAAAAAAAN_A/LirwvwjHfNs/s716-no/IMG_4463.JPG" alt=""><div class="caption">This bowl of popcorn is the only one who will watch Chris Soules with me.</div></p>

<p><strong>- Become a laundry tornado.</strong> 
Since we’ve just deep cleaned both our apartments, I’ve been trying to keep my clothes orderly. But left to my own devices, I am kind of a mess.</p>

<p>It’s good to get my <a href="http://www.runningwithspoons.com/2015/02/19/thinking-out-loud-118/">thoughts outloud</a>, and while I’m a little insecure about having a month without J around. (Am I destined to eat every meal alone? What happens if I lock myself out? etc) I’m hoping that by putting this out there, I get a lot done, rather than getting depressed and becoming a total recluse. </p>

	<div class="date">

	</div>

	<p>Hey all. Sorry I’ve been so MIA. I spent the weekend with my sister in Vegas watching the <a href="http://www.usasevens.com/las-vegas/">USA Rugby Sevens</a>. Embarrassingly, this international tournament is the first time I’ve actually watched rugby, despite the fact that my sister has played it for almost 4 years now. (Yes. I am really the worst.) But we had a lot of fun, the seats were amazing, and the games were great.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-mRRj5Oxx0-A/VOOE02-R8mI/AAAAAAAAXFA/JRHdyDpX5FE/w1041-h604-no/IMG_7191.JPG" alt="photo of me at the field"></p>

<p>For Christmas, I shelled out for seats right behind the try (the goal posts) and we watched with some of the biggest fans in Rugby. The row of gentlemen behind us were ex-pats from England, and I basically fell in love with them for their cheers. </p>

<p>If anything was good it was “Get it lads!” or if one of the England players missed a pass, “Oh what a muppet!” and when France played England I heard choruses of “The only reason France plays Rugby is for another excuse to wear Spandex.” or “No wonder France is trying Rugby, they don’t have anything they’re good at anymore now that California makes the best wines.” The kid sister and I couldn’t keep from cracking up.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-tNz7Zw-bI3M/VOOCxcGAijI/AAAAAAAAW6Q/6-yzouNKa5Y/w955-h716-no/IMG_7138.JPG" alt="photo of the sister at the field"><div class="caption">My sister and I look a lot alike.</div></p>

<p>We stayed at the team hotel, so we were constantly surrounded by giant rugby players. In the casino, at the bar, in the pool. It was a blast to feel like part of the team.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-br067BSLe6o/VOOE7Yl_DtI/AAAAAAAAXFU/Abyfizi486A/w537-h716-no/IMG_7197.JPG" alt="photo of drink at field"><div class="caption">The meaning of rugby. Alcohol and the Pitch.</div></p>

<p>We made our way around Vegas in the two days we had off.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-wTybrPrJGGk/VOODN4gI_oI/AAAAAAAAW9A/YnQkmI_ugSg/w953-h716-no/IMG_7053-MOTION.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>My suggestions? Drink all the novelty drinks. Explore all the stores. Walk the strip about 100 times. :)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-hbwqcV9d8K0/VON-_BJrWiI/AAAAAAAAWxg/meyPhQEFqgA/w537-h716-no/IMG_7046.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>My secret though? I’m terrible at Vegas. I’m not much for gambling, clubbing, smoking, or strippers. I like keeping my money, and that’s hard to do in Vegas. To be fair, we couldn’t stay out very late, because in order to get the best seats, we had to be at the field at 8 am. It was fun to visit for a weekend, but I would have been pretty bored if we were there much longer.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-aFt9ZSi-ylk/VON9c_IKZ3I/AAAAAAAAWp8/aXp9lnHa2G0/w955-h716-no/IMG_7005.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Have you been to Vegas before? What’s the most obscure sport you follow? </p>

<p><em>I’m catching up on all my blogs this week after having no service for five days. Sorry if I kill you with comments, likes, or love.</em></p>
