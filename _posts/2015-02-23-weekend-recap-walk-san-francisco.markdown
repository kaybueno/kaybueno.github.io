Given the weather around the world, I feel a little guilty posting this weekend recap. My pictures will give away the temperature out in Northern California. It was around 65 degrees, and a hot 65 at that.

I want to tell you how beautiful it was to walk around all week, but given that everyone else I know has sidewalks covered in ice. I’ll let the pictures do the talking.

Saturday morning I headed down to the Embarcadero, to check out the farmers market. It’s in my opinion the best farmers market in the city, albeit a little crowded by 10 a.m. One of the big draws is the fact that they have multiple street food vendors, and so it’s a great place to come grab brunch, and some cheap, delicious fruit too.

While I’m excited to have a lot of free time since J is gone for the next few weeks, I also was worried that that might manifest itself into me just hiding at home because “it’s not worth going out” or “I don’t want to eat alone” or “I don’t know what to do.” So one of my goals was to stay out of the house as much as possible. After leaving the farmers market I stopped for a tea at Starbucks (it was 8 a.m., and a little chilly for me)

I spent a lot of time walking around, perusing stores. Did you know San Francisco has a Neiman Marcus Last Call? It’s kind of like the Nordstrom’s Rack for Neiman Marcus, or the inbetween of store and outlet. It’s beautiful, has gorgeous designer gear, and ugh. I almost caved to a pair of Frye boots marked down from $430 to $185, but then I realized money doesn’t grow on trees.

Lunch was calling me, so I headed to Basik. Acai in San Francisco is a dangerous thing. I tried to go twice this weekend, it was sold out by noon on Sunday.

In the evening I met up with a friend to play bocce at a bar. I totally forgot that bocce is fun, and I was actually passably good at it. 

Sunday morning I grabbed brunch with friends. I was so busy chatting I didn’t even remember to snap a picture. After hanging out with them for awhile, I went walking again. I actually ended up walking over 23 miles between Saturday and Sunday.

After a lot of walking, I was really feeling a smoothie, so I stopped at [Earth Bar](http://earthbar.com/) and grabbed their Miami Beach. It was really light and refreshing, it’s made of Pineapple, Papaya, Banana, & Coconut Water, so it was a nice way to rehydrate.

Later in the evening, I met up with [Cassie](http://almostgettingittogether.com/) for my first ever SoulCycle class, found out I can sweat even more than I thought I could, and ate a great homemade dinner (thanks girl). 

After a weekend like that, I don’t really want to go to work today. :)

How was your weekend? Did you try anything new?
