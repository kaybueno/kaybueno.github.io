I love the feeling of anticipation right up until I have to take the first step. During the morning, I dream about running, until I hit the moment where I need to lace up my shoes and take off. When I’m just ready to go, I hit that initial dread of the activity. What if it goes wrong? What if I hate it?

So it’s no surprise that now, the night before I embark on a primarily liquid diet, that I feel that ache in the pit of my stomach. Unboxing soylent. Beautiful. Showing the packaging off to my boyfriend, amazing. But as I go to eat my “last supper”, I feel uneasy.

I received my shipment of soylent last week. And because I’d like to pretend my life demands fanfare, I refused to begin a liquid diet on a Thursday, because as any yo-yo dieter knows, diets must begin on a Monday, to give you the entire weekend to binge and feel bad about your choices.

Soylent comes in a ~2000 calorie pack, and advertises ideal nutrition. As I’m a woman, and relatively sedentary, I plan on experimenting with my calorie intake until I find a good medium. Ideally somewhere between 1000-1500, depending on my activity levels.

All this said, I’m still a social person, and I plan on eating normal food over the weekends so my boyfriend isn’t driven insane by my food experimenting, and hopefully so I can’t ruin my digestive system (and other body systems?) too much.

At least I have until tomorrow.
