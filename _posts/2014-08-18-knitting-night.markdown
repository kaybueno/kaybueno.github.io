I'm learning to knit, and projects like this always inititally frustrate me because I'm not perfect at them.

But now, I look at my running, or biking. When I started those, I was so slow, and so awkward. Lately though, I'm fast, and I feel good when I do it. So I try to remember that the same thing is true of everything I do in life. I'll be bad at first, and then eventually, and very very slowly, improve.

My starter scarf.
