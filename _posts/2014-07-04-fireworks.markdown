I’m not a firework person. I’m not an America the beautiful person. I don’t get most rah-rah holidays to begin with. But I went to the local fireworks with family, and I took some cool pictures and have to share.

Even though people camped out at the venue all day to get good seats. We arrived like 30 minutes before show time, and snagged great digs right where a funnel cake vendor was closing. (Note to friends, and hey, even enemies. Don’t watch how your funnel cakes are made. I would quicker eat mixed concrete.)

The show was set to music, which was actually pretty awesome, and they timed the explosions to hit key points in the songs. There were even little heart fireworks for a song about love. Unfortunately most were upside down, but it’s the thought that counts.

Despite taking about 120 fireworks pictures with my iPhone, none contain the heart. Cool story.

All together, it was actually pretty cool. Even if it meant I had to listen to Katy Perry’s firework song like 20 times. I was a huge nerd and took a bunch of pictures, filmed the entire finale, and said “oh my god” way too many times. 

Who knows, maybe I’ll come around on the Fourth of July. Might be my favorite holiday next year.
