Woah, it's already Monday. This weekend went by so fast. Here's the Spark Notes version of my life the last three days. :)

Friday night we fit in two shows that my boyfriend wanted to go to, they both started at 8. Fortunately, one band was the opener, and the other was the headliner.

So, we started with the opener, [The Congress](http://www.thecongressmusic.org/), one of my boyfriend’s favorite folk rock bands. 

And then we jetted off to see [Hoodie Allen](http://www.hoodieallen.com/), an old, like high school old, friend of my boyfriend’s. If you haven’t heard Hoodie, I would affectionately describe his music, as white boy rap-pop.

The Congress was laid back, slightly buzzed 30 and 40 somethings, so we were at least 10 years younger than most of the crowd. But Hoodie Allen was mostly high school girls, the show was a lot of jumping, cake throwing, and confetti flying.

It was almost surreal how different the two were.

Saturday, J and I spent the day urban hiking. I really wanted one of the most delicious and guilty burgers that evening, and so we wanted to work off the burger in advance. We did a hilly 10 mile loop in the city.

We focused mainly on Mt. Sutro open space reserve, which gave us some pretty cool views of Sutro Towers.

Sadly. Despite our serious hike. We couldn’t get reservations for burgers. So the whole hike was for nothing. Jk. We had a lot of fun.

Finally, Sunday I hung out with [Cassie](//www.almostgettingittogether.com) and [Gina](//www.instagram.com/ginamarie_hlc)

We also rocked an urban hike in the Presidio. It went by super fast thanks to a lot of venting, wine, and really amazing grapes from the farmers’ market.
It kept me close to the ocean, so I was pretty happy

J and I made up for a burgerless Saturday by indulging Sunday night instead. I would have a picture of my favorite burger in San Francisco. Unfortunately I literally could not wait to eat it. So I didn’t even sneak a picture. You’ll have to imagine it.

How was your weekend? Ever been to a crazy show?
