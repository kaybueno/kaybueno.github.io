On the Big Island, we stayed in the cutest B&B right outside Volcanoes National Park. Bamboo Orchid Cottage is basically a giant house buried in the middle of (what feels like) the rainforest. The owner is fantastically fun, and takes great care of the place, when we came in after hiking, the fireplace was lit, a soothing CD was on, and the room smelled amazing. 

But my favorite part was the breakfast:

The owner made us all lobster shaped papaya boats! The fruit on Hawaii was so fresh that I could have eaten two of these every morning. So delicious. My other favorite (and one of the only things I bought in Hawaii) was this adorable running shirt.

The store was so cute, and when we walked by I had to run in and have it. Had to. I can’t wait to do a race in this sucker.

We spent some time hiking Akaka Falls, hiking is a strong word as it’s just a tiny loop. But unlike in Maui, the falls here had water! It was a beautiful destination, but be warned, they make you pay to enter, even if you don’t park in their lot.

J and I hit up some other scenic points. They were nice, but I was tired, and not feeling so well. Fortunately, J took picture duty.

We flew back to Maui, since we were departing from there, and checked into our hotel. I was only feeling worse, so we ordered room service. It was my first room service ever. I took a picture, even if I didn’t really eat any of it. :/

Still feeling ill the next morning, I sent J out to our snorkel reservation. I was bummed I missed it, but his pictures are too amazing not to post.

We flew home that evening. It was an amazing trip, and we really got to enjoy good weather, and no internet connection (a lovely break from the all the time internet connection we have). J and I definitely hope to go back seeing as we’re closer to Hawaii than NYC now. :)
