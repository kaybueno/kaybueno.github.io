I live in a tiny little studio, I affectionately call the cardboard box. Housing prices are crazy in the Bay Area, so even if you have a relatively good job, you’re basically stuck with a room in an apartment from the late 1800s (beautiful victorians), or a unit in a complex built in the 1950s (ugly concrete/stucco boxes). I have the latter.

This year, our complex manager offered 100 dollars off January’s rent to anyone who decorated their apartment’s exterior. While some of the units have small yards, big windows, and cute entryways, my exterior is basically just a door. Decorating for apartments is hard enough, can't paint, can't leave a mark, no giant tear down DIY projects. So here’s how I made it work. (Because let’s be real, I am motivated by money!)

This is my washi tape tree door. I don’t have any electrical outlets around my building, so I couldn’t really do a beautiful light display. And I’m shelling out for gifts right now, so I didn’t want to drop a ton of cash on decorations. The solution? Washi tape.

Washi tape is thin, colored, plastic-y tape that originated in Japan. It’s kind of like, thin plastic painter’s tape, or masking tape. It definitely doesn’t have the holding power of like, duct tape, but it comes in the most beautiful array of colors and patterns. And best of all, scotch is carrying it now, so I found a bunch of them at target, and staples.

I had seen a lot of small, desk decoration type, washi tape trees on the internet. And decided to do it on a bigger scale. I basically freehanded the tree, and then added the decorations. 

Before the mini ball ornaments, I tried a tree with tinsel. While I loved the tinsel texture, the weight of the garland made it so I had to constantly add more tape to it. And the abstract and messy nature of tinsel took away from the tree shape.

Washi tape’s major benefit to me, is that it doesn’t (or hasn’t) damaged my door in any way. I removed the garland with no sticky residue, and no paint pulled up. It’s a fun way to decorate, or let kids decorate the walls, door, etc, without having to worry about damage.

All in all, it was an incredibly cheap option. Less than 15 dollars. I spent ~3 dollars per roll of tape, ~50 cents for the bows, and ~4 dollars for a bag of mini ornaments. (To be fair, I had the cord from another project, so the string didn’t cost me any money.) And even better, I’ve finally met my neighbors because people keep stopping by to ask me about it. (Probably because they too want the 100 dollar credit, but I’ll blame it on my art skills.)

How are you decorating this year? Have you used washi tape before?
