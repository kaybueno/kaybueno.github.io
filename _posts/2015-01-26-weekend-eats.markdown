Thanks so much for all your sympathy over the crash! J has mostly received tough love from his manly roommates, and so it was nice to read all your lovely comments to him.

This weekend was the least vain weekend of all time, I managed to take almost no photos of myself. Partially because I was home, helping take care of J, and not out adventuring, and partially because I spent most of my weekend eating really delicious food.

Saturday night I went out with [Cassie](//www.almostgettingittogether.com), to Cha-ya. It’s a vegetarian/vegan Japanese restaurant that is so hole-in-the-wall, it doesn’t even have a website. Which may be the norm for non-chain restaurants in a lot of cities, but even the [grass fed hotdog stand](http://www.letsbefrankdogs.com/) in my neighborhood has it’s own site. So not being on the internet here is kind of a big deal.

Sunday night I met up with a friend to try out a Rhythm and Motion dance class. It was quite an adventure, primarily because I barely have rhythm, and mostly have motion. My biggest takeaway? I totally underestimated dancers, I was dripping in sweat by end.

I know I probably shouldn’t take on more things, but I really loved the class and might continue to go on Sunday nights. Can you pick up dance if you’re only doing it one night a week?

After class we met up with another friend and cooked dinner. Or really, to be fair, they cooked me dinner. It was phenomenal, and I apologize that my pictures don't do it any justice. I was too focused on enjoying the company and the candlelight to take good photos.

We planned the dinner around my friend who is doing keto (with some serious success!) I was mostly impressed with how delicious keto is. Yum. Bacon. Egg. Cheese. Yum.

This is one of the first times I’ve been convinced you can cook better at home than in a restaurant. Everything was amazing.

The cutest picture of my weekend? A sleepy great dane I ran into on a walk I did. He, or maybe she, was chilling in the front of a designer eyewear shop. Makes me miss my mom’s dog.

How was your weekend? What should I do about the dance class? How often do you work out in a week?
