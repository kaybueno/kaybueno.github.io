Crazy week everyone. I swear, once we get into the week of Thanksgiving, everything goes by so fast. Work is busy, life is busy, weekends are busy. Blogs are neglected! I’m catching up with everything, but I wanted to show off my weekend.

Embarrassingly, I was having so much fun this weekend that I neglected to photograph most of it. I’d like to blame my roof, dinner, and drinks drinking. But that’s unfair. Mostly I was just too busy talking or sweating to take photos. :)

First. I found and purchased Coconut La Croix. Fyi, for those curious, it’s definitely sweet coconut flavor, not like, sparkling coconut water. It’s delicious, and I’m depraved so I took a bunch of selfies with it.

I like it, and I want to make a cocktail out of it basically. It’s kind of a perfect pina colada base. 

Saturday morning I spent picnicing on [Cassie’s](www.almostgettingittogether.com) roof. It was amazing, filled with wine, almonds, popcorn, cheese and really really delicious crackers.

I skipped out for a bit and got my nails done.

Shakira, my nail bff, is literally the best gel nails of my life.

I met back up with [Cassie](http://www.almostgettingitogether.com), [Gina](http://www.instagram.com/ginamarie_hlc), [Davida](http://www.thehealthymaven.com), and Davida’s boyfriend for dinner. We grabbed some pretty delicious Japanese food at Chotto.

The lighting was bad but the sushi and drinks were delicious.

Sunday I hit up some adorable boutiques in the city. I spent most of my day wishing my teeny tiny studio apartment had room for a card wall:

A small child to dress in adorable clothing:

And more room in my freezer for sweet potato soft serve:

I ended the evening with a hot yoga class that [Cassie](www.almostgettingittogether.com) found. Fortunately, there is no photographic evidence of this because it was so hot, and I was so sweaty by end, that I’m pretty sure I looked like a wet dog. Beautiful.

How was your weekend? Are you feeling the holiday time crunch!?
