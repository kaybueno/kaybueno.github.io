Lately my life has been focused on two things. Getting into half marathon shape for the Pittsburgh Half, and work. My days go like: wake up, get ready, walk to work, work, run, walk home from work, prepare snack, sleep. So, while it’s kept me busy, it’s also been a hard thing to blog, or read blogs, or keep up with the Bachelor, or really anything that’s not walking/running, sleeping, eating, or working.

But I have serious love for [WIAW](http://thebigmansworld.com/) (and our sexy new WIAW host). And I can’t imagine missing it even if I’ve been a slacker.

Breakfast:
Two vegan pancakes, a scramble, and bacon. I’m not sold on this breakfast yet, but I’ve been eating it for the past few days. I love eating it, but I’m not sure it’s keeping me as satiated as it should be.

Lunch:
I’m sharing two lunches, one I ate Monday to brag, and Tuesday’s for honesty. Monday, I went to our new salad bar, where they’ll mix you a custom salad, yum.

 And Tuesday I had salad and flatbread. :)

A coworker and I stopped at the juice bar for a snack. Delish.

And then I had an unpictured Quest bar and an apple pear. Yum.

I didn’t run yesterday since I usually run Mon, Weds, Fri, and Sat. But I’ve been really hardcore about clocking in steps on my Fitbit. I’m at a little more than 120,000 for the week, or close to 9 miles a day. So I walked to Trader Joes a few miles away, and walked home. 

I picked up some truffle cheese, and fig and olive crisps. And ate those right before bed.

To be perfectly honest, I’m hoping in the near future to lose a little weight (and it’s been working). So this is kind of the start of what I’m eating. I’m trying to incorporate more and more vegetables, and less other things. But it’s a process.

How are you eating? What are your usual go tos? What do you do when you life is super busy?
