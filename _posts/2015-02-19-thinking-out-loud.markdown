J is leaving this morning on a round the world (okay, round the Europe) tour for work, which means I’m boyfriend-less for 18 days. While I’m sad (no cuddling for 18 days!) I’ve also been trying to think about, plan and fit in all the things that are better J-less:

**- Eating a lot of healthy and/or vegan food.**  
J is one of those people who, whenever a recipe says “Your boyfriend/friends/whatever won’t be able to tell the difference from the real thing” I know the recipe writer hasn’t met my boyfriend. He’s not easily swayed by black bean brownies, or tofu mousse.

**- Going to bed at 10 pm.**   
J and I have a sweet bedtime compromise. I’d love to go to sleep at 10 p.m. and wake up at 6 a.m.. And J would love to rock a 3 a.m. to noon type schedule. So usually we fall asleep between 11 p.m. and 12 a.m. and get up between 8-9 a.m. While J’s away, my bedtime is going to be grandma level.

**- Hit up some new exercise classes.**  
 Usually, J and I opt for hikes, or long bike rides when we’re together. But with him gone, I plan on trying some new things. Cardio barre, or contemporary dance anyone? :)

**- Catching up on bad TV.**   
J is not a fan of the bachelor, or Scandal, or How to Get Away with Murder, or Are You the One? So while he’s gone I hope to binge on trashy wonderful TV. As long as it’s the only thing I binge on, I’ll consider it a win.

**- Become a laundry tornado.** 
Since we’ve just deep cleaned both our apartments, I’ve been trying to keep my clothes orderly. But left to my own devices, I am kind of a mess.

It’s good to get my [thoughts outloud](http://www.runningwithspoons.com/2015/02/19/thinking-out-loud-118/), and while I’m a little insecure about having a month without J around. (Am I destined to eat every meal alone? What happens if I lock myself out? etc) I’m hoping that by putting this out there, I get a lot done, rather than getting depressed and becoming a total recluse.
