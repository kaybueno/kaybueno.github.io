This weekend, to embrace the storms in SF, J went up to Tahoe in hopes of good snow, and I stayed in the city to meet [Angela](http://nuttyforlife.com/), who was in visiting [Cassie](//www.almostgettingittogether.com). 

While I enjoy time with J, there’s something refreshing about spending a weekend with people who want to take pictures of everything, always order a salad, and actually enjoy beets. 

I met up with Cass and Ange at [Kin Khao](http://kinkhao.com/), a super cute Thai place downtown. Turns out it’s on the [Michelin Recommended list](http://www.michelintravel.com/selections/2015-san-francisco-michelin-selections/) (always a great way to find restaurants), and it definitely lived up to its recommendation. The food was amazing, the curry was potent, and the vegetables speak for themselves.

The next morning we were off to Napa. We hit up [Scribe](http://www.scribewinery.com/), an artisinal winery and vineyard in Sonoma, which is probably my new favorite winery of all time. If you go, you’ll fall in love with the land, the wine, and your sommelier. I know we did.

The weather behaved and we ended up having a beautiful sunny morning at Scribe. Drinking in both the view, and the varietals, there’s so much to talk about that I have to save Scribe for it’s own post.

Everything on Saturday was really low key, so no one was bothered as I climbed on a bench to snap a quick photo.

After Scribe we hit up [Mumm](https://www.mummnapa.com/), known for their sparkling wine, we were excited to get our bubbly on.

But after the beautiful scenery, our personable host, and the phenomenal wine at Scribe, it was hard to enjoy the cookie cutter feel of Mumm. When we heard the table next to us get the same specials speech, it felt a little dry.

At least the glasses were beautiful, and fun to drink.

We went with the staff favorites tasting. While I wanted to love the sparkling pinot noir. My favorite was the DVX 2009, (second from the left).

We left and grabbed the most delicious food (and another 3 cups of coffee) at [Farmstead](http://www.longmeadowranch.com/Farmstead/Restaurant) in Napa. While I neglected to take pictures, I strongly recommend it. The beets, the salad, and the fish were off the charts.

On Sunday we headed to Palo Alto to grab Pressed Juicery’s Freeze. Basically, froyo made of their juice flavors. It’s one of those foods I would eat daily if it were in the city, primarily because the vanilla almond milk freeze is 40 calories. Yum.

All in all. A pretty killer weekend. 

How was your weekend? Have you been to Napa yet?
