Thanks to Jury Duty yesterday, J and I were able to play around in the city after my case was released.

Despite living in the city, I don't actually work in the city most days. So I rarely catch San Francisco while it's still light out during the week.

Lately, I've felt like I have a lot to do, and so it was nice to have a government imposed day off, but I'm glad my case didn't end up going to trial. I don't think I could survive 2-3 weeks of a court case.

How's your week going? If you had a day off of work, where would you go?
