True Life: I was a total recluse over Thanksgiving week. Basically. Sorry I disappeared over the break. It wasn’t that I was doing anything particularly exotic, or time consuming. Mostly. I just wanted a week off from everything. I wanted to sit in freezing Chicago, eat food, watch my siblings play video games, and just like turn my mind off.

So. Here are the mindless things I did in my time away. :)

Walked a silly 5k.  My brother is on doctor’s orders not to run. So my sister and I hammed it up throughout the race.

Baked a ton of cookies. If you saw what I was eating this weekend, it would have been #fatfluential. ([This recipe](http://www.averiecooks.com/2013/10/candy-corn-and-white-chocolate-softbatch-cookies.html) plus any additions is basically perfection.)

Kitty sat this little munchkin, who’s literally a munchkin kitten. Every time I get near a cat or a dog, I get serious pet envy and end up browsing Pet Finder for a week. Bad life choices.

Hung with the family. Most of this time was spent in straight up sweatpants with a cookie in one hand and coffee in the other. To spare you from that picture. Here’s a snapchat from the morning’s run.

It was a blast. But I have to say. I missed looking at this. It’s nice to be back somewhere where the sun shines. (Even though today it is pouring in SF. Hello 3 hour commute and flooded roads.)

How is your life lately? Did you cook, bake, stuff your face with anything for the holidays?
