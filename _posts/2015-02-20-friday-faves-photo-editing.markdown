I openly love to take in flight shots. Although, since I’m almost always leaving California, and flying east, they all have looked like that lately.

Speaking of photos, I wanted to chat about some of the photo editing stuff I love. I am admittedly, still strapped to my iPhone for most blog pictures. But why make a bad thing worse? 

My most recent fave is definitely [Darkroom - photo editor](https://itunes.apple.com/app/darkroom-by-bergen/id953286746) an app that mimics the best Lightroom features for your iPhone. Full disclosure, one of the founders is a friend. (However, I paid for the app, so.)

But believe you me, I’m not the only one who thinks it’s the best, it has [rave](http://www.theverge.com/2015/2/12/8025141/best-photo-editing-app-darkroom-iphone) [reviews](http://petapixel.com/2015/02/12/darkroom-ios-photo-editing-app-diy-filters-curves-infinite-history/) [from](http://www.cultofmac.com/312063/darkroom-like-best-adobe-lightroom-iphone/) [multiple](http://www.popphoto.com/news/2015/02/new-app-darkroom-photo-editor-ios) publications (including the [NYTimes](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/19/technology/personaltech/tools-to-make-meetings-more-productive-and-maybe-more-pleasant.html?_r=0)) and appeared as one of Apple’s best new apps.

It looks something like this:

And within each image you can adjust the curves, use filters, and more importantly create preset filters for yourself. I’ve heard, although I don’t know much, that it’s similar to vscocam, but more customization.

Both of the following images went through Darkroom.

I’m not super knowledgeable about photo editing, but I’ve never had a moment using it where I felt like the unedited picture looked better.

Additionally in the realm of photography, I back up all my phone pictures to Google+. This is two fold, one because I’m biased towards the Goog. But two, because I actually think account security, and photo editing are way better in G+. Aka. My photos aren’t going to be leaked in some celebrity nude-gate.

G+ has a feature called “Auto Awesome” which tries to analyze photos and figure out how to improve them. This can be anything from looking at a series of similar photos and building one where everyone is smiling, to making collages out of photos that historically go together. 

A lot of time, computers and algorithms are naive, and so it’s often an “Auto Awful” more than an “Auto Awesome”.

But recently I got this gorgeous pano from my Vegas photos. It's a lot more striking larger, but I love good panoramas!

Last but not least. The cutest Valentines Day food ever. This guacamole. I didn’t spend good old V-day with J. (although he did get me the cutest card, and gifts). But at least I spent it with the next best thing. Avocados. (oh, and my sister).

What are your favorite things lately? Any photo tricks that you use?
