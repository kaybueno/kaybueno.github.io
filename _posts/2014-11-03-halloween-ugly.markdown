I’ve never been the type of person to have a ton of school spirit, or any type of spirit. I wasn’t the kid who dressed up for football games, or Halloween, or events or conventions. I don’t begrudge those who do, on the contrary. I’m a little jealous. I wish I could put something amazing together for every holiday, and pull it off. 

Fortunately, J’s the same. Except, this year we had a Halloween party that we had to have costumes for. And I found this out… 2 days before. So I threw together a costume of things I had in my house.

A white t-shirt, brown eyeshadow, lipstick, food coloring and corn syrup came together for a pretty serious zombie. Work loved it, but a few coworkers freaked out. Definitely an ugly costume, and not the traditional sexy one.

It worked great with J. His hazmat suit (a legit Amazon purchase) and my seriously ill zombie were couples costumes without being like, Peanut Butter and Jelly.

But my whole weekend wasn’t spent sitting in sticky corn syrup blood and heavy makeup.

I had a nail appointment with the best salon in San Francisco. Legit, I’ve tried at least 4 different salons with gels. Every single one I had cracking by the third day. And they do gel nail art. Shakira at [Sparkle](http://sparklesanfrancisco.com/) is my fave. I seriously shell out for her every single month. That’s how long her nails last. An entire month. (If you don’t mind some grow out!)

The only thing as good looking as my nails, was chilling with [Cassie](http://almostgettingittogether.com/). We got the most beautiful beet salads ever at [Blue Barn](http://www.bluebarngourmet.com/). Seriously. I want to eat this every day of my life now. Forever and always.

Not to make it look like my entire Sunday was food, but between coffee and lunch we stopped at the Fort Mason Farmer’s Market. Super adorable. I bought some candied walnuts and walnut butter from a stand by [Old Dog Ranch](http://olddogranch.com/). The candied walnuts were just okay, but the maple walnut butter was out of this world. I got a mini jar, and thank god, because I’m literally like half way through it one day later.

It was the coolest weekend, and I’m only sad I didn’t take more pictures! Now it’s back to work, and writing interview feedback while watching How to Get Away with Murder.

That said, while the start of the week sometimes sucks on the work horizon, I love using it to structure the other five days. I’m hoping to get a bunch of yoga and running in this week. Hold me to it. 

What’re your goals for the week?
