Yay! [WIAW](http://peasandcrayons.com/2015/03/what-i-ate-wednesday-213.html) is back!

I’m going to write today like it was the most delicious day ever, but that’s likely because it was the first day I ate after three days of juicing. Don’t get me wrong, the juice was great (and hey, I’m down 4 pounds [of mostly water weight]), but it’s nice to eat real food.

According to most cleanses, I did a terrible job eating after. I had a less than mediocre amount of vegetables, fruit, and light broths. But to me, today was great. I wasn’t craving things all day, and with my serious lack of cravings, I’ve been working on transitioning off diet soda. I felt wonderful, even if this isn’t what you should typically eat post cleanse.

The most unappetizing picture, but the most delicious breakfast. This was a sriracha, bacon, egg and cheese (on dutch crunch) sandwich with melon and apple.

Lunch there was a BBQ pop-up. I grabbed flank steak, roasted broccoli and whatever the salad was.

I work at a magical place, where for no reason, someone will bring a skewer with tortellini, tomatoes, and cheese to your desk. It’s hard to say no to that.

Back to regularly scheduled snacks. I had a handful of pistachios. The best.

And then later on some beef jerky. I love Fieldtrip a lot. I used to eat a lot of Krave Jerky, until my boyfriend pointed out it had more sugar than protein. Woops. Now I grab this guy.

I went on a run in the evening, so I wasn’t very hungry at dinner. I went home and watched the Bachelor Girls Tell All episode. (Guys, I’m so team Whitney. Sorry, not sorry.)

Literally 10 minutes before bed my stomach rumbled. So I grabbed a handful of “Pressels” a baked pretzel chip thingy I bought at whole foods on a whim. They’re a great snack that doesn’t make me want to immediately eat the entire bag. Yay for portionable things! And yay for the cutest chip clip ever.

What have you been eating lately? Are you watching the Bachelor? (I am the least big fan of Chris Soules, but I love (almost) all the girls this season.)
