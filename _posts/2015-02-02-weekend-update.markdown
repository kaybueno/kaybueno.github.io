Ain’t no party like a Communist Party, ‘cuz a Communist Party is mandatory.

This weekend we celebrated the fact that two of J’s roommates, and also the fall of the Berlin Wall have been around 25 years with a “Communist Party”. (If slightly off color humor, or potentially offensive recreations of history are not your thing, avoid this post.)

We crafted a foam Berlin wall to bring down at midnight and celebrated the fall of communism. While this may be the oddest party theme ever, there were a surprising amount of good costumes. A testament to the crazy things you can get at surplus stores on Haight St.

While, usually, I’m not much for big raging parties, it’s fun once or twice a year to feel my age and do it up. It’s also not every day you find out what your boyfriend would look like as Ronald Reagan. So. There’s that.

Sunday morning I was supposed to run a 5k, while [Cassie](//www.almostgettingittogether.com) did the half. Unfortunately, after a night of bacchanalia, I was not ready for the 6:30 a.m. wake up call that came along with the run. So I made amends by offering to grab brunch.

We hit up a carnival themed cafe, and J convinced me to get this incredibly delicious monstrosity, aka a Chicken and Waffle sandwich. Easily one of the best waffles I’ve had. Which was good since waffles are both wonderful hangover food, and half marathon recovery food.

I then did the most un-American thing imaginable, and ditched the Super Bowl to run errands with Cassie. It was magical and now I want to buy everything imaginable from West Elm. Thank god I don’t own a car to haul it back to my house in.
