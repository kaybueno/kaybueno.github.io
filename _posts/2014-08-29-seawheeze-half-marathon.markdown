Looking back at SeaWheeze, my only wish is that I would have taken more pictures. Because, the more I think about it, the more I realize, everything we did there was beautiful. Our B&B (O Canada House) was this amazingly cute Victorian, with fancy plated breakfast, yummy pastries, cute puppies, and the sweetest owner. The weather was perfect all 3 days, the scenery was gorgeous. Really, you couldn't have asked for a better weekend.

Unfortunately, I'm not perfect, so I mostly gawked at everything around me, and didn't snap near enough photos. After my mom and I hit up the Showcase Store, we went to pick up my race package. :)

Talk about no line, we waited maybe 5 minutes to get to a booth and grab the goods. My favorite part of the pack? The Chip Wilson race chip. And the water bottle that we got as swag. I was pretty tired from the early morning, so after getting everything we went back to the B&B, grabbed breakfast, napped, and walked back to the convention center to check out (but not participate in) yoga.

It was surreal to watch a few hundred people doing yoga in the open air. As much as I wanted to join, I'm kind of glad I didn't. I am out of yoga practice and would have been sore the next day. Which I've heard isn't good when you're running a half marathon. 

Speaking of. The next morning, I woke up at 4:30 (again...) to get in line for the half. Since it was my longest run ever, I was incredibly incredibly nervous about doing things right. I was nervous about eating at all before the race, and ended up just having a piece of pumpkin bread before heading over to the convention center. I took a picture in front of the brunch sign before running, so I'm pretty sure I didn't deserve anything yet. (But at least I looked good at this point.)

We were led through a really rousing warm up of jumping jacks and other light exercise. Unfortunately, the warm up was at least 50 minutes before my wave (1:10) made it to the starting line. So I'm not sure it helped much other than to get me in the spirit of the run. It was super easy to find the pace beavers, and they pumped us up, and gave the whole wave tattoos to help track our times.

Unfortunately, I'm bad at kilometers, so this wasn't very useful. But it did stay on, despite all the sweating. I was able to keep pace with the group until about mile 6. Where I started to falter. And by mile 9, I was ka-put. I was a little bummed, but since I had kind of slacked on my long runs right before the race, it's really what I should have expected.

Fortunately, the race was a lot of first timers half marathoners, so I wasn't the only one who got tired around this point. The worst part of faltering early was that the last few miles of the race are gorgeous. Runners are weaving around Stanley Park. But at this point all I was focused on was FINISH THE RACE and DON'T DIE. So I hardly paid attention. 

My mom was the best cheerleader though! She caught me at 3 of the cheering stations. Unfortunately photographing runners is both hard, and super unflattering. So here's an okay looking back-shot of me and quite a few other runners going around the water.

But! I did finish, without medic nor dying. And coming in at 2:29 means that I'll definitely PR SeaWheeze 2015!
