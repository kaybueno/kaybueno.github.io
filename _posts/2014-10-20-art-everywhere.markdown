I read on Friday night that Adobe was unveiling a new mural in our neighborhood at 8 am Saturday morning. However, there was no way I was going to get J up before noon to look at one mural. (Heaviest. Sleeper. Alive.)

So on Sunday after brunch we stopped by to get a look.

The goal, if I remember correctly, is to spark creative moments for passers by. The artist figures people keep their heads down and ignore their surroundings when they walk, and murals like these make you take notice of your surroundings. People were definitely noticing it when we were there, there was practically a queue waiting to snap photos.

The mural is in a larger “park” area, that often holds fitness classes, has super adorable coffee and juice bars, and is generally a fun place to explore. And so we did!

The fitness section had some serious monkey bars.

J did them with ease. I tried, but it was a total failure. Since most monkey bars are in parks for kids, I always have the safety net of being able to put my feet down. But these were definitely designed with adults in mind. Both J and I had to seriously hop to grab. On the first bar my sweaty palms slipped right off. One day I’m going to go back with some chalk and more resolve, and try again.

The last installation was this bucket list inspired piece:

I loved some of the answers, like: “Do a barrel roll.” or “Kiss someone I love in the rain” or “Help beat cancer.”

It’s silly, but one of the more frivolous goals I have is to be able to do the splits. I didn’t put it on the board, and I’m not sure that it’s something I need to do before I die. But seeing what everyone else has on their bucket list made me think of it.

What’s something you want to do before you die?
