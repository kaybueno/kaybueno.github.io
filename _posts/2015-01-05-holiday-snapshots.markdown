Chicago was a whirlwind of food, fun, family and friends, but mostly food. I spent 14 days catching up, baking, and reminding myself exactly how much I hate winter.

I had an amazing time, whether it was schooling my brother’s girlfriend at Mario Party, shopping with my mom at Lululemon, or hanging out with every single person I loved in college.

It was cold, and my family had anywhere from 6-8 people crashing in a 3 bedroom home. Which meant we all had a little bit of cabin fever, and were a little bit too friendly. One day, after we were sick of our laptops, I let C cornrow my hair. 

While the cornrows turned out nice, and eventually ended up in cute curls. It was a painful, crazy idea. :)

J visited for a few days, prior to vacationing with his roommate in Mexico. (And only packed one bag for both trips. Crazy!). We dragged him to our favorite, locally made, ice cream spot. He was excited but very very cold.

One of my Christmas gifts was a croissant baking class at Sur la Table. It was basically magical because you didn’t have to do any cleaning, and I got to eat a lot of warm croissants. I'm not sure I'll ever make a croissant like the ones in Paris, or even the ones at Tartine in San Francisco. But I definitely upped my bread game.

I make a lot of faces while baking.

On Christmas, my family does fondue. Cheese, meat, and chocolate. It’s delicious. But my sister always ends up outeating everyone when it comes to the beef. So much this year, that I called her Edward Steakerhands.

Posting this makes me miss Chicago already. :)

How were your holidays? Are you getting back into schedule?
