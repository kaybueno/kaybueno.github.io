Lately, I’ve been a part of Sweat Pink’s #NoExcuses challenge, and this week they asked us to “Share why YOU live with #NoExcuses”.

And when I received that email. I almost laughed. See, I definitely don’t live with #NoExcuses, I live with many excuses, loads of excuses. In fact, I’m probably on my way to being the queen of excuses. 

And when it comes to exercising, I’m that person who throughout the day, is thinking of all the socially appropriate ways to evade my gym plans. But when the clock hits 6pm, I (usually!) still go work out. Because, while I live with a whole bunch of excuses, I make sure I eliminate them.

My most popular excuses and how I combat them:

1. I don’t have my [article of workout wear], so I can’t workout today!
---------------------------

This has been as pathetic as “I don’t have a hairband, guess I can’t go to the gym!”

To beat this excuse I use my filing cabinet, not for documents and files, but for spare gym clothes. Currently I have 5 shirts, 2 pairs of socks, a spare pair of shoes, a million hair ties and a water bottle.

2) I have a lot of work to do, and I’m too tired to workout.
---------------------------

This is probably my most convincing excuse, because my job does take priority over fitness. (Otherwise I'd do 8 hour days of vinyasa and soul cycle. But it doesn't pay the bills yo.) 

And it might be a good excuse if there wasn't a gym onsite where I can always get a speedy workout in. Even if I'm so brain dead I can't manage the gym, I can always take a 30 minute walk to think things over.

<br>

3) I can’t find time to work-out, or there's an event I can’t skip is going on when I usually head to the gym.
----------------------------

I try to remind myself that fitness is a priority, and that many people wake up incredibly early in order to squeeze it in. (Like 5 a.m. early.) I can (and should) do that too.

To me, living #NoExcuses isn't a matter of never having excuses, it's working on subtracting them until you get to #NoExcuses. 

Excuses are part of my day to day, but moving past the excuses is what makes me proud, it's what makes me a competitor, and it's what makes me live "#NoExcuses".

What are your excuses? And how do you get past them?
