It was one of those weekends, where you end up doing so much, you want another weekend after to relax. (In a good way!) It's still in the 60s and 70s in the Bay, so I'm trying to get out as much as possible before the fog rolls in.

We completed the Guinness Book of World Record’s [longest corn maze](//www.coolpatchpumpkins.com). That map. That map is the maze. We died a little inside completing it, but we conquered the corn.

J really wanted a hay ride to celebrate his corn maze completion. Unfortunately there wasn’t one. So we made our own. Corn Maze - 0, Kay and friends - 1.

[Cassie](//www.almostgettingittogether.com) and I hung out again. It was, in a word, magical. If you don’t have a friend you can sweat with, vent to, and eat delicious food with. I totally suggest finding one.

I took my first Surf Set class. Love at first wipe out. 

I want to tell you all more about it (and I will later this week!), but I had to brag a little about my weekend while I’m still so pumped from it. :)

How was your weekend? Try anything new?
