Spoiler alert. I ran Run 10 Feed 10, and I was bad. 

Let's start from the beginning though. I woke up at 6 am to get ready for this race. I had carefully prepared all the things I needed the night before. However, my morning brain couldn't remember where I put them. So I spent like half an hour freaking out and looking for them. Good going Kay.

I pulled myself together, and hauled myself to Crissy Field. I was pumped. The views were beautiful. There were a ton of runners. It was good. I started snapping some quick pictures from the field of the bridge.

I hate subtle foreshadowing, so I'm going to be obvious here. The bridge looks pretty high up from where I was taking photos. I thought nothing of that at the time. The morning was beautiful, there were cute booths. I got to put on a temporary tattoo and got prizes for taking selfies (basically my dream). The world was good.

Women's Health put on a killer display. There were a bunch of adorable sponsor booths. We warmed up with a very calm instructor from a local yoga studio. They had tons of photographers coming around snapping pictures, making me feel like people should always be taking pictures of my pre-run festivities. 

They lined up the runners into different pace groups. I wanted this to be a chill run, and didn't want to feel super competitive (I did this run to take pictures of the bridge!) So I put myself in the last group.

And we started! There wasn't a lot of fanfare for this. I hit the button on my cheapo Garmin, and started my playlist that I haven't updated since Seawheeze and started running. 

The photos of the bridge, are pretty killer. And the road was blocked off, so I didn't feel overcrowded or anything.

However. This route starts with a whole lot of uphill. Annnd. Elevation and I aren't friends. Furthermore, if you know how a bridge works, it's basically sloping up and down the entire way. 

On my recent runs, I haven't been feeling any fatigue until mile 5 or so. On this run, 2 miles in and I was gross. Sweaty, and breathing heavy, and a real mess. While they had water at the other end of the bridge, there were not enough water stations in the world to fix and hydrate me.

I finished the race at an embarrassing 10:30 pace. And looked something like this at the end:

I could give you the 150 excuses I have for a bad run. But it really boils down to lack of practice. 

That said. Run 10 Feed 10 was beautiful, and amazing. And if you get the chance to run over the Golden Gate Bridge, you should DEFINITELY do it. At the end there was a delicious bagel and fruit spread, dynamic stretching (I waited 30 minutes in line for this and it was worth every second), and a great yoga session.

Please, tell me of your successes this weekend. I went to the Bridge School Benefit after this, and got to feel really good about my fitbit step count all day. So all in all, not bad. :)
