I am going to blow your mind this week. (Maybe, probably not). If you know me, you know I don’t cook. I mean, up until yesterday I didn’t even have a can opener in my kitchen. (I bought one after I realized the only way I could open my can of coconut milk was to bludgeon it with a screw driver. Oops). This [Wednesday](http://peasandcrayons.com/), I actually made some of my own food. 

Breakfast:

Vanilla coconut chia seed pudding. I am in love with chia seed anything, and so I decided, I had to learn to make this. I don’t have the perfect ratio for this yet (but I’m cloooose). I love my pudding a little less liquidy.

Lunch:

Work lunch. This was a side salad, a cup of vegan potato leek soup, and a piece of whole wheat flatbread with chicken and bacon. Totally delicious. 

Snack:

No. I did not eat four larabars. But it’s hard to take a picture every time I want to eat something, so this is from when I bought them. I had the carrot cake. It kinda let me down. I think I’m too much of a child. Only chocolate chip cookie for me. 

Other snack:

Someone was giving out chocolate outside of my building. Yes please.

I had an apple somewhere in here, but I didn’t snap a photograph. Imagine an apple. 

Dinner snack:

I don’t love dinner. But I do love the fact that I’m popping my own popcorn lately. I take some kernals, and coconut oil, wait for them to pop. (And also freak out when they pop. I dropped an entire spoonful of popcorn kernals on the ground when one popped in my face.) Then I smother this in nutritional yeast and a dash of salt. Delish.

What have you been making lately? I've been experimenting on a peanut butter mug cake. I found the most irresistable peanut butter chips at Whole Foods this week. :)
