When it gets dark at 5 pm, there’s basically no chance for me to get out during daylight. 

So I’ve been daydreaming about what life would be like without daylight savings, and reminiscing to a hike J and I did a few days before the time changed. 

Castle Rock State Park is one of my favorite places to hike, even though it’s probably better known for it’s rock climbing, bouldering, belaying, rappelling and more. :)

But I love it for the views

Castle Rock’s trails actually connects to the ones at Big Basin, so you can easily hike for 30+ miles. But J and I traditionally do the Saratoga Gap trail to the Castle Rock camp grounds and then back through the ridge trail past Goat Rock. Which is a really detailed way of saying we hike for 6-7 miles. :)

Saratoga Gap puts you on an exposed ridge where you do a lot of scrambling up and around rocks to keep hiking. It’s probably medium strenuous. Like, we haven’t taken J’s parents, but any of our friends could rock the route.

My favorite part is that all the rocks are fair game. You see people like this:

Or just J and I climbing around on small 15 foot rock formations.

Not to be left out of my own blog, I took a selfie or two during the hike.

J and I eventually want to backpack here, because it’s one of our favorite South Bay hikes of all time. 

How’s the time change treating you? Have you still been getting outside?
