I almost cried over two out of three of those today.

I’ll fill you in. I have a huge crush on Jonathan Adler. I don’t even know what he looks like, or if he’s a good person. But I love his designs. So when he came out with a cheaper department store line, I bought a ton up. 

Unfortunately I had to ship it to my new apartment, and in the process, one of my favorite pieces, an elephant lamp shattered. :( I’ve been super glue-ing him back together, but I’ve had to glue so much, I ran out. Here he is in a mostly fixed state.

Then today, on the way to work, I got a flat tire on my bike. Which seemed okay, because I had a tube and pump at work. So I worked at replacing the tube (I’m a total bike fixing novice, this took me basically forever), after many attempts to pump my bike, I found out the needle was broken, so the new tube won’t even inflate. 

Here was a glory photo from when I thought I fixed it. Haha. WRONG.

Otherwise, my day was amazing. I took a beautiful walk at lunch and came across the most bizarre 80’s style fitness track. You can walk around and stop at all these little stations in the woods to work on different skills. I skipped the fitness stations, but eventually I want to come out and play with the rings station. One of my dream goals for life is to be able to do a pull up, and it could be fun to do some aerial skills on this thing:

Soylent today has been good. It’s hard doing an experiment on yourself. Like I’ve felt a little eugh when it comes to digestive issues. Fortunately, I have yet to become a noxious gas machine like some drinkers report. (Knock on wood). But I definitely felt a little on edge today. However, two of my coworkers went home sick. So is it a stomach bug? Soylent? Guess I’ll find out in a few days.

My batch today tasted the best yet though. Getting good measurements on a food scale has helped a lot with that. (Since I don’t want to drink a whole 2000 calorie bag). And actually, this is probably disgusting, but I don’t mind it luke warm. I chill it overnight for whatever reason, but I actually kind of enjoy it after it’s gotten back to room temperature. 

Whatever, I’m crazy. Hope everyone else’s day went better than my own. :)
