By the time you read this, I’ll already be on a 6 am flight to Vegas. My sister are headed out there to visit cupcake ATMs, walk the Strip, and most importantly watch the Rugby Sevens.

This week has been crazy, and SFO airport is honestly one of the saddest airports when it comes to food. More than that, I’ve always been one of those people who likes waking up early in the morning, but hates doing things early in the morning. Let’s be real, when I’m up at 5 am, my first thought isn’t what gourmet breakfast I’m going to cook.

Which is why, I’ve been making the Sex Kitten Salad, from [The Skinny Confidential’s new book](http://www.amazon.com/The-Skinny-Confidential-Health-Lifestyle/dp/1624140459). (Ask me about all the recipes I’m trying from it!) I've been following [Lauryn Evarts](http://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/) for an embarrasssingly long amount of time, she opened me to the world of [shaving your face](http://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/2014/04/23/shaving-face-but-women/), makes me want to improve my [travel essentials](http://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/2014/06/08/traveling-essentials-ramblings/), and keeps me envying her killer style with her [mini delites](http://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/2011/10/22/mini-delites-5/).

This simple fruit salad is easy to customize, develops even more flavor overnight, and can be made with things you likely even have in your fridge. And with the leftovers, you can rock some of The Skinny Confidential’s, [5 second chia seed jam](http://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/2014/10/16/busy-deal-5-chia-seed-jam/). (In blueberry instead of raspberry, natch).

**Serves 1.** *(but you should make more, because trust me, everyone’s gonna want some)*

**Ingredients**  
1 handful of strawberries, sliced  
1 handful of blueberries  
4 hefty pineapple wedges, chopped  
1 kiwi, skinned and diced  
4 tbsp/30 g Greek yogurt  
2 tbsp/20 g chia seeds  

**Spices**  
Cinnamon, to taste  
Pumpkin pie spice, to taste  
Nutmeg, to taste  
Optional: fresh mint leaves  

**Directions** *(So basic, I shouldn't even have to tell you.)*  
Combine all ingredients in a large bowl and toss lightly. Add extra spices on top. Garnish 
with mint (optional).

While I layered mine parfait style, I think this would look lovely served over yogurt in a glass bowl, or laid out by fruit type on a tray for brunch.

It’s been a welcome change from my bagged eggs for breakfast, and I might try it with coconut cream instead of yogurt for a paleo twist.

What’s your speed breakfast? How do you save time in the morning?

*I was sent “[The Skinny Confidential: A Babe's Sexy, Sassy Health and Lifestyle Guide”](http://www.amazon.com/The-Skinny-Confidential-Health-Lifestyle/dp/1624140459) but, I’ve actually been eating my weight in this salad, so all opinions are my own.*
