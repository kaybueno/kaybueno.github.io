Today was one of those days that started with the water heater not working. Unfortunately, when you’re trying to wash your hair as infrequently as possible (for its own health!) and you’re on day four or five. You have to shower. Needless to say, my day didn’t begin on a great note.

It was packet pickup for Run 10 Feed 10, which is a 10k by Women’s Health that crosses the Golden Gate Bridge. I’ve only ever crossed via car, and I love trashy health magazines. So J and I walked to the running store to pick up my packet.

Despite the fact that it’s November, we scrambled out in tshirts because the weather here is still in the 70s. It’s crazy. Halloween is in a week.

The Run 10 Feed 10 bag was adorable. But hilariously, I’m most excited for the temporary tattoos. I missed doing the “Run Yoga Party” spray on tattoos for Seawheeze and so I’m making up for it.

We ended up with another free bag for Google Shopping Express (a same day delivery service in the Bay). Their logo is a parachute, and so they sent out these adorable themed bags.

Reusable bags are a pretty big deal here, since it costs 10 cents to buy disposable bags at any store.

When we got home we had already walked a bunch around the city. So I snapchatted my family really attractive faces while J worked.

I’ve got dinner plans and an early bedtime waiting for me tonight. (Race starts at 7:30ish) Eugggh. 

What’s the best swag you ever got? (I hope it’s not temporary tattoos, otherwise, we gotta talk.)
