I survived an incredibly busy crazy weekend off Soylent.

To try to maintain some social life, I’m not drinking soylent from Friday night to Sunday night. It allows me to still indulge in regular food, crazy activities, and life without a blender bottle strapped to myself.

The most adorable things I ate this weekend:

In more exciting news! J’s coworker got married this weekend, which called for a lot of celebrating. The wedding was north of the city in San Rafael, aka Sun Rafael because it’s soooo much warmer. The ceremony was a balmy 90 degrees, but the reception cooled down to a sweet 70.

The oak the ceremony was held under. The theme? Love grows here.

Overall, this weekend, Soylent taught me how much extra I’ve been eating. I felt more uneasy eating full meals, and I’ve been noticing the heaviness of certain ingredients (sugar, sugar, sugar). My stomach gets upset when it gets to a level I would have considered full just a week ago. And I find myself taking slower, smaller bites.

On the bright side, spending a week on soylent makes everything taste more flavorful. Spices are hotter and more complex. Cuts of meat seem much juicier. Produce is almost unreal after four days of an unarguably bland liquid. 

I’ve had mixed feelings about returning to my Soylent only diet tomorrow. Part of me is incredibly excited not to have to think about food. It complicates my life a lot. But another piece of me is sad to give up on all the flavors, tastes, and overindulgences I’ve had this weekend.

I’ve definitely seen a trend down in my weight over the days I’ve had Soylent, which is unsurprising and also wonderful. I’m hoping this mix of soylent and “normal” food will continue to work for me.
