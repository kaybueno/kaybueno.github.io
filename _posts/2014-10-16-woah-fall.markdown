Up until today, my life still felt like summer. California has been bright, sunny, and warm. I had yet to bundle up in anything more than a t-shirt. Heck, even the trees were still bright green.

But today, that all changed! Now, it’s unquestionably fall. And it all began with a pumpkin.

A 1600 pound pumpkin for that matter. Someone had delivered it to the office, and it was as tall as me (and I’m 5’10”.) And just… giant. All I could think of is how many muffins, scones, and spice lattes you could make with that sucker. Delicious.

Then, at lunch, I got roped into (read: I totally volunteered for) making decorations for my company’s Halloween party. It’s Alice in Wonderland themed (isn’t that the best? Spooky and whimsical without being cliche). So today I helped fold some of 800 paper roses.

Folding was a nice break from my typical daily work. The directions were super easy, and surprisingly, despite a bunch of us all working at once, the flowers turned out great. [This](http://pldevents.com/how-to-paper-flowers/) is basically exactly what we did. Everyone at the table kept remarking that it felt like they were crafting for their wedding all over again, and how much they missed the DIY aspect of planning for it. By lunch end, we had knocked out about 100. The Queen’s maze is going to look great.

Decorating for Halloween and giant pumpkins started getting me in the fall mood. But then I walked into yoga tonight, and the class door was open to the outside, and it was freezing. Finally the temperature was telling me something. It’s fall.

We closed the door and got to class. This yoga is called “Creative Yoga and Flow”, and it's the first yoga class I ever took. The first time I took from this instructor, when she was fixing my form, she gasped and cried out (to the entired class) “You need yoga! Your muscles are so tight. You work out too much with no yoga.” While simultaneously flattering (I work out!) and embarrassing (omg did everyone hear that), her class has been great for me to deepen my stretches in the basic poses.

As you can see, I’m ready with my mat, block and strap, well before the class starts. I can’t lie, I like to be on time. But my biggest pet peeve, is people who walk in late. 5-10 minutes late? Totally fine. 30-45 minutes late in an hour and fifteen minute class. Ridiculous. By that point, I’m in the middle of class, holding a pose, and the student who just walked in is asking me to move. Totally throws me off. 

How’s your day been? Feeling fall? And what’s your biggest pet peeve?
