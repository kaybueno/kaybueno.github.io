Greetings from Chicago. I’m finally home for the holidays. 

Do you ever have really terrible ideas you don’t realize are terrible until after you’re stuck? Welcome to me, with my flight home. For some reason, I thought it was a great idea to go with the cheapest Southwest one I could find. Which meant on Saturday, I was on a plane from 2:00pm-8:30pm. Total day killer.

I made up for my Saturday’s transgressions by spending time with family. I did some last minute shopping, and came across this train.

I wouldn’t have even noticed the train, or sat in it, or even posted about it, if it didn’t have a very very angry sign.

The sign said, and I quote “CHILDREN ONLY IN SEAT. NO CLIMBING OR HANGING. DO NOT DAMAGE. VIDEO MONITORING PRESENT!!!”

Post shopping, all the girls in the family (and my surprisingly-jaunty-after-getting-his-intestines-removed brother.) got together to bake and decorate cookies.

The women in my family have been baking cookies since I was 4. Each year we end up taking on more and more cookies varieties (fortunately, we keep adding women to the family, by love or by birth).

Everyone’s cookies represent their individual baking, decorating or eating style. My youngest cousin topped everything in sprinkles, I used a small star point to fill my cookies, and my grandma dipped everything in chocolate. 

Notable cookies are the “Pokeball” sugar cookie, and the “I will kill u” star. We’re not murderers here, it’s just that my brother is very allergic to red dye, and so my sister (who has a mean hand with a piping bag) always makes a few sarcastic cookies.

After 5 hours of flour, sugar, butter, and love. We finally finished and took a quick photo of the gang.

It’s memories like these that you don’t forget. Partially because it’s so much fun, and partially because that red frosting is never coming out of the carpet.

What does your family do for the holidays? Do you have a “signature” cookie?
