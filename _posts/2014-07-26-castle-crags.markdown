This summer our vacations have been beautifully formulaic. We choose a place a few hours out from San Francisco. Book a shitty motel in the area. Then hike, bike, and eat the local food.

Since day one in SF, J has been wanting to go to Shasta. So bam! We did.

Because we are nowhere near cool enough, we decided not to actually hike Shasta itself. Mostly since we wanted to spend our time just looking at it. And also because, it takes like a whole day, and it was 108 degrees outside. So hot.

We ended up at Castle Crags, a pretty sweet hike. We started from a parking area, and climbed. Since we believed the things we read on the internet, we hear this was going to be a 5 mile hike, total. Unfortunately, since we never looked at a map, we didn’t realize that it was 5 miles to the top, and 5 back down. Oops.

The hike had about 2000 ft elevation gain over a 5 mile windy path. And then the last 500 feet was a lot of scrambling up rocks. Which I pretty much hate the most ever. I always feel, regardless of how much actual safety there is, that I’m going to fall down. So after a few minutes of scrambling, I told J to go ahead, and I’d wait. I was tired, it was hot, we were running out of water.

He made it to the top, it was amazing and beautiful, and I’m still glad I didn’t go.

Fortunately, on the way down, we stopped at this small, .2 mile hike to Indian Springs. Where there was potable water! I have never been so happy in the world ever for potable water. It was beautiful and amazing, and the best thing ever. We drank a lot of spring water, and then ran down the mountain for 5 miles. 

I took a shower that flooded the entire bathroom. But I must say, a crappy motel bed and threadbare blankets never felt so good.
