Guys. I don’t want to jinx it. But, the new year has me motivated. Real motivated. Like, spend-two-hours-power-cleaning-your-apartment-when-you-get-home-from-work motivated. 

And it’s been spilling over evvvverywhere. One of the things I knew I needed to rock in January was my eating habits, especially important after I consumed no less than 23495 Christmas cookies while home last week.

So I’m trying to rock way more vegetables, way less sugar, and just a generally healthier eating schedule. So welcome to my favorite day of the week, [WIAW](http://peasandcrayons.com/2015/01/ate-wednesday-207.html).

Breakfast is standard. Greek yogurt, so much coffee, and asian pears.

Welcome to “put your lunch over a salad” salad. One of my good friends in Chicago used to be a chef in a fancy Vegas restaurant, and when I told him about this food strategy, he threatened to disown me. Apparently, greens don’t automatically pair well with “everything”.

So this is shredded pork, guacamole, jalapenos, pico de gallo, over a salad. I couldn’t decide between the salsa roja, or the yogurt based salsa demente, so I used both. :)

Snack was an old favorite. Popcorn, which I grabbed a handful or two and put into a vintage Santa mug. I’d like to say it’s because I still have a lot of Christmas spirit, but really it’s because I’m too lazy to put away my decorations.

This is the post where you find out my hands are literally like paddles, or giant oven mitts. But I grabbed a handful of nuts. Best part? NO PEANUTS. I hate nut mixes that are dominated by peanuts. Put them in a nut butter, great. Put them in a trail mix and I’m over it.

I had a grand total of three of these parmesan crisps (15 is a serving). But they were so delicious and satiating that I needed to include them. So enjoy the speckled brown that is my dirt floor, and do yourself a favor (if you like dairy) and get on these, or make them.

Usually, I’m not much for dinner. But I’m trying to rectify that, and realize that popcorn is not a vegetable. So here’s salad part two. I try to relish in the fact that by eating this salad I’m now ahead of [75% of Americans in vegetable eating](http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/wk/mm5935.pdf).

Last, unrelated little tidbit. Today is the best Wednesday regardless of what I ate because it’s my mom’s birthday! Even though I hopefully already texted and called her, I want to wish her a third, or fourth Happy Birthday. 

She’s not only had to put up with me for over 20 years, but she’s down for anything, we’ve done flying trapeze, surfed, and this year we’re running Seawheeze together.

So Happy Birthday Madre!

How’s your Wednesday going?
