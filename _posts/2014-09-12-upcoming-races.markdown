I think all I’ve been doing lately is working, sleeping, and signing up for races.

One of the reasons I keep signing up, is to keep myself running. So I want to pad out my races to approximately one a month. I'm almost covered until the end of the year. But it's a little spotty in some places. I like doing races that (generally) don't require fundraising, don't have colors thrown at you, or zombies, or photoshoots, aren't super religious, and are relatively fun. With that said, here’s what I’ve got so far.

A philanthropic 10k put on by Women’s Health. I’m super excited because I’ll get to run over the Golden Gate Bridge. (I’ve only ever driven under it. Ooops)

My family’s celebrating Thanksgiving with the ugliest 5k of all. I’m super pumped for this 5k. Both to run alongside (and beat) my siblings. But also because I’ve put together the most hideous Christmas apparel of all time!

I chose this race because a 15k is like the lazy man’s half. And I’m lazy. And it’s super flat. And there’s chocolate at the end of it.

But I got tickets! A race I love so much, I signed up a year in advance. This was literally one of my best experiences this year. It sold out in under a half hour, but both my mom and I managed to sign up.
