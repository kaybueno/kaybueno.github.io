Getting things done over this long weekend. My closet has been the ultimate mess since I moved in. I bought these cheap wire storage bins to store clothes. Spoiler alert, they didn't work. So I spent today re-doing my closet/dressing area. First order of business, get a real dresser.

I went to Ikea, even though every time I build a piece of their furniture I promise myself I will never ever go Ikea again. But then they're so cheap and easy that I forget the building hell, and I keep coming back.

Final product. I still need to hang some things for more color!
