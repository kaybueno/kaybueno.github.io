Brrr. It's the first cold morning in my house. I've been dragging my little space heater around everywhere I go, and drinking tea like it's going out of style or something.

I've seen this survey around a bunch, and I was tagged over the weekend to do it by [Emily at Sweets and Beets](http://sweetsandbeets.com/), her blog is super cute, you should totally check it out. 

**Four Names That People Call Me (Other Than My Real Name):**

1) Hurricane. (I was not always a neat person)  
2) Katie (Kathryn is the full name)  
3) Melissa (because someone has mistaken me for my best friend)  
4) Jolly Green Giant (7th grade is not a good time for nick names)

BFFs who apparently look similar from behind.

**Four Jobs I’ve Had:**

1) I was a concession, box office, clean up worker at a movie theater. There were probably 2 years of my life where I only smelled of butter.  
2) Waitress and Bartender at Chilis  
3) Sandwich maker. This was a low point in my life, the deli made such good cookies, and we could take as many as we wanted home after work.  
4) Software engineer. My post college job. :)

Hilariously, while most of my other jobs had serious food prep, this cooking was a fun trip for my software engineering work.

Good times ahead with the sister I look nothing like.

**Four Things I’m Saying:** 

1) “Oh man.”  
2) “Did you hear about…” (Some article I likely found on Facebook)  
3) “I don’t know.” (To my boyfriend who asks more questions than Who Wants to be a Millionaire ever did  
4) “Sounds good to me.” (Everyone at work says this.)  

I'm terrible at choosing people to tag, there's too much pressure! So if you haven't done this yet and want to get a little bit of reflecting in. I'm tagging you! (But tell me so I can check it out!)

What movies should I watch more than once? If it's on Netflix, bonus points. What's your favorite food lately?
