Being off routine is hard. And I’ve been out of whack this week.

I flew Monday night into Baltimore. Drove to Maryland. Slept for 4 hours, and then woke up to interview a bunch of awesome students. The campus was gorgeous

I finally felt like I was experiencing fall.

Then I flew back Wednesday and had a lot of work waiting for me. I’ve basically been holed up at my desk and home until today when I helped with the company Halloween party.

Now I’m putting together a last minute zombie costume. (Oh god)

Mixing up some fake blood as we speak. 

What are your weekend plans? Halloween parties anyone?
