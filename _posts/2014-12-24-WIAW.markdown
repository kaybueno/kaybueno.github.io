Good morning! (Or really, whenever you happen to be reading this). Usually, on Wednesdays, I break down all the delicious things I eat for [WIAW](http://peasandcrayons.com/2014/12/merry-christmahanukwanzaakah-wiaw-205-2.html). And today isn’t any different, except that, this morning, we had our big family Christmas.

So this late blog, is brought to you by sugar-cookie, animal-shaped waffles.

I’ve been home, in Chicago for the week, so aside from the time change, the weather change, and the change in scenery, my eating schedule also feels wonky. Lunch and dinner feel too early, all the food tastes different, etc. By Wednesday, I was kind of craving my normal.

One of the great things about having homogenous work offices is it’s easy to get similar food everywhere. So after the serious cookie overload, I was ready to get something a little healthier in me.

I started with fruit and a biscotti.

Lunch was a salad with pico de gallo, corn, olives, and root vegetable puree, carrot ginger soup, and a cut of arctic char (Which I found out, after watching Alton Brown on the plane for 5 hours, is a close relative of both salmon, and trout, aka delicious).

Mid-day, the chef team put out vats of hot chocolate. Who was I to say no?

I actually didn’t end up finishing it all, and when I washed out my cup, found a layer of sprinkles caked onto the bottom. Can we say, addiction?

When I got home I had a tea and some sugar cookies. Not like I was ever going to escape those. I think every day of the holidays should include some amount of cookies. 
Not pictured are the copious cups of coffee I’ve been drinking, and the small mountain of other sweets I’ve been enjoying since everyone is in a baking mood.

A merry, merry Christmas to those who celebrate it! I hope you all get wonderful gifts tomorrow, and stay close to family. While I rocked the gift giving and receiving today, tomorrow I get the best gift ever, because J lands in Chicago to spend the week with me. :)

What are you hoping to receive? What’s the best gift you’re giving? Have you eaten as much delicious food as I have recently?
