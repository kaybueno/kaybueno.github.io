It’s one of those Mondays, where I can’t believe it’s Monday already. I think it has a little something to do with the fact that I spent my entire weekend here:

Time flies a lot faster on a mountain.

J and I spent the weekend in Tahoe with fifteen of our friends. We rented a cabin, bought an unwieldy amount of food from Costco, and skied our hearts out. J, my ever patient boyfriend and ex-ski-instructor, spent most of his time trying to teach me how to come down a mountain without dying. 

I mostly succeeded.

It was my second time skiing. Even though I didn’t make it to the blue runs, (in fact, I kind of freaked out about the one I did), I had a blast. 

While I think taking lessons from someone close to you can be a disaster, I learned really well from J, and didn’t kill him (neither death by ski crash, nor death from over critiquing my form). Which is pretty much a relationship win in my book.

Even with 15 people, the cabin went smoothly, we didn’t trash the place, get too drunk, and we didn’t cook all our breakfast bacon at 3 am. Which the group took as a positive sign we’re getting older. We all returned home safely, and to the most beautiful sunset I’ve seen ever.

Today, I’m pretty much sore everywhere, and I feel really energized. Which is a pretty great excuse to spend a weekend doing something new. I’ll definitely be skiing again soon. :)

How was your weekend?
