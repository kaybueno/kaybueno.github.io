After a few days in Maui, we decided to hop on over to the Big Island. While there were lava reports on the radio, we didn’t see any active lava. We didn’t think it would be in good spirits to tour on someone else’s devastation. So instead we spent a lot of time at Volcanoes National Park exploring previous eruption sites.

We woke up early the morning after our flight to head over to the park. We wanted to start the day by stretching our legs, so, we hiked the Kīlauea Iki Trail to the Thurston lava tube. It’s a 6 mile hike into what was once a lake of lava. Having since dried out, the crater is a great place to explore volcanic scenery. Getting there early led to much more amazing pictures. By 10 am, tons of tourist buses had offloaded, filling the crater.

We learned a lot about what happens after a volcanic eruption, and getting to see the rocks and crags up close was great.

J was really into the learning aspect of the crater, and I was really into the making fun of J for learning so much about a crater aspect.

Though it’s a kind of random picture, a few days before, I had caught a surfboard with my arm while surfing, and had developed a pretty serious bruise. I wanted to preserve it with a photo. Better my arm than my face, I guess. :)

We scaled out of the crater and into the lava tube, where bus, upon tour bus was parked. The tube is a great in and out jaunt, but it didn’t really offer much when compared to the crater. And the pictures inside made my inner photographer cry. With all the flash, poor lighting, and people everywhere, it didn’t lead to great pictures, or a great experience.

After, we drove the chain of craters road. The views were awesome, but the road was more hyped that we’d have liked. It’s a 20-30 mile road that stops where a lava flow crossed the road in 2003, blocking the path.

At the end of the day, we saw our first real lava sighting. We drove to the Jaggar Musuem to watch the lava out of the Halema'uma'u Crater. It was a really beautiful experience. We got in right before sundown, and stayed until sunset.
