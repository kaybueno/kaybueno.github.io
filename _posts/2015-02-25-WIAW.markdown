Between you and me, I’ve never done a juice cleanse before. I like eating, and I’m not always a fan of how juice cleanses are marketed. I think my liver does a fine job of getting rid of toxins, and I’m not sure I really need to detox anything.

But, I have wanted to try one, with a juice bar on every corner in SF, it’s hard to not wonder. And I don’t think my metabolism, and body are so fragile that 3 days of 1200 calories in juice will hurt much.

Cleanses are kind of expensive (even with the deal I used), and so I wanted to do it “right”. So this whole week I’ve been eating vegan, and getting progressively more restrictive with my diet. The makers suggest “you cut out alcohol, processed foods, excess salt, white flour and bread products, and refined sugar a day or two before the program and load up on fresh fruits and veggies.”

For breakfast I made some coconut chia seed pudding (coconut milk, chia seeds, a drop of agave), and sprinkled a bit of this granola on for crunch. Delicious.

Lazy lunch. A veggie sandwich with spinach, onion, tomato, avocado and mustard. And a tofu and tomato soup. I’m lucky that work labels all their vegan options, but man, it’s kind of difficult to find things that don’t feel like sides.

Post lunch snack of coconut chips, and hot tea. I’ve been drinking a lot of herbal tea during this in order to cut down my carbonated beverages problem.

Desk picture of these super delicious bean chips. They’re very reminiscent of doritos, complete with seasoning that ends up all over your hands. I really loved them.

Black bean brownie bites I made from [this recipe](http://minimalistbaker.com/vegan-gluten-free-black-bean-brownies/) but with coconut sugar instead of raw cane. I added the sprinkles when photographing otherwise they look like bean hockey pucks. They’re good, but they definitely taste “healthy”. Whenever people tell me their friends can’t tell the difference, I always wonder if they have really polite, or really healthy friends. I’d eat these at home, but I wouldn’t bring them to a party.

Unpictured are the handful of cashews I snarfed. I had a hard time with vegan food this time. I’m used to a lot of protein, and I think not having easy options for protein made me ravenous and freezing cold all day. I paired a small dish of the chia seed pudding with a brownie this morning for breakfast and feel much better. So I'm just aiming to eat more beans, nuts and tofu today.

It’s fun to try vegan, especially while J isn’t around. 

Have you tried a cleanse? What vegan food should I try out?
