Warning. Animated gif heavy post. :)

It’s [pouring in the Bay Area](http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2014/12/11/bayareastorm-best-social-media-posts-capture-rain-wind-and-flooding/) right now. Fortunately, I was able to make it to work without a canoe. Unfortunately, most of my coworkers would have needed some sort of water transportation to get here, and so, I’m nearly alone in the office (I count 15 people, usually there are ~200). 

On the bright side, my work is super cool, and so today, we converted one of the office spaces into a skating rink.

I cannot contain my excitement.

The “rink”.

So, first things first. It’s technically not “ice”. It’s a polymer, that they cover with vegetable oil, to make a slick skating surface. When you’re on it, it’s a lot less slippery than ice. I stepped on expecting to immediately bite it, but instead, I spent 10 minutes waddling around trying to figure out how hard I had to push to skate.

My coworker figured out the mechanics a lot faster than me. 

It was actually a lot more tiring than it looks, because it’s not ice, you have to use a lot of effort to get enough momentum to skate. 

Between the fake snow, the pop-up ice rink, and the churros and mexican hot chocolate provided, we had a blast. At one point my team even had the whole rink to ourselves. It made me want to head out to a real ice rink this winter.

Another image of me being excessively excited. When you live in an area that never feels like winter. (It’s a balmy 60 degrees with rain), it’s nice to have a little fake snow and ice to make it feel like the holidays. 

How’s your workday (or home day) going? Are you good at skating?
