Two years ago. I didn’t have any hobbies. None. Not because I was busy, or because I had just moved, but because I couldn’t stomach the fact that I might look dumb doing something. 

I was incredibly insecure. I thought that I needed to look effortless, and attractive, and cool, all the time. And that meant not taking on anything new, because I wasn't sure I could do it perfectly.

(This is probably what I thought cool looked like.)

In the event I did end up out of my comfort zone, I wasn’t good at it, I’d just quit. I know, real winning attitude there. It was terrible for me, and probably worse for the people I was around. 

And I might not have ever really tried anything if I didn’t accidentally stumble upon a hobby I loved.

Flying trapeze. 

I finally wanted to be good at something so badly, I was willing to be bad at it to do so. Flying trapeze was the greatest high (literally) I had ever had, and I was addicted. I was also terrible. I'm inflexible, and tall, and altogether difficult person to catch. But it was amazing. And being bad at trapeze was the best thing that happened to me.

I figured, once I was a total novice at one thing. Why not make a fool of myself doing all the things I wished I could do?

So I started running.

And yoga.

Today. Am I the best at any of these things? 

Not even close. I run 9-10 minute miles, I'm just now able to touch the floor in a forward fold, and I'm still the slowest trapeze student to pick up new tricks. I read the most amazing blogs of friends who are spin instructors, serious yogis, competitive runners, and I think "Oh god, what am I doing here?"

But even as an inflexible, kind of slow student, I'm the happiest me I've ever been. I've stopped comparing myself to others. I'm much better at celebrating achievements, and I let myself try anything.

With the New Year rolling around, and goals being on everyone's mind, I want to remind you that you are more than the things you're good at, and it's worth trying anything you want to do even if you fail fantastically at it. I would have never run a half, or swung tricks out of lines if I didn't allow myself to be bad at things first.

In the immortal words of the cartoon show Adventure Time:

“Dude, suckin’ at something is the first step to being sorta good at something”.

What do you suck at?
