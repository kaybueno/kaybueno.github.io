This whole week I’ve felt under the weather. I’m pretty sure this is what happens when you start feeding your body actual nutrients after a two week diet of sugar and alcohol. 

I’ve been taking it easy, a lot of my coworkers have been out sick, and I'd hate to make it worse. But my body really did me in this time, because while I was chilling at home in a shark onesie, trying to figure out what my stomach would consider eating.

My boyfriend was meeting Chris Hemsworth (who he keeps adorably referring to as Liam.) I got this Snapchat as I was laying on the couch, wishing I could surgically remove my intestines.

I’m feeling better today, but that’s not the point! I could have been there if it wasn't for my scumbag stomach. :)

I saw this candle on someone’s blog this week (sorry I forgot who, my memory is terrible). And because I’m an impulsive child, I bought it Thursday night. 

Big surprise. It smells like cotton candy, or just straight up sugar, or some saccharine sweet smell you know immediately. And while it’s not the candle I’ll use to seduce my boyfriend into a romantic night (unless your boyfriend loves candy, then this IS your candle), it’s a fun scent to have burning.

And while I’m not usually a food candle person, I’m glad I grabbed this baby at Target. For 10 dollars we can make my house smell like all the best parts of a carnival. :)

Finally, I took this picture covertly at work of our fruit situation. Is it just me, or does fruit seem more legit when it still has the leaves on it? I keep picking the mandarins that look like they’re still growing on a tree somewhere.

I hoard like 3 of those puppies a day. Don’t judge.

Anyhow! I'm off skiing this weekend. This is the second time in my life ever, and J's like 3409803945 time. He was an instructor for a brief period of time, so I try to use him for lessons to save money. :)

What are you up to this weekend?
