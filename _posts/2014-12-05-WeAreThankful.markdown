If you’ve looked at your calendar, or don’t live under a rock, you know that Thanksgiving has already passed us by. But today, at work, I was grabbing lunch with a friend who works on the events team. In a nutshell, her job is to throw super amazing parties, lunches, and holiday celebrations for the company. Despite all the perks of her job (getting attend lavish parties, sweet relationships with cool vendors, etc), she told me she feels best about what she does when people thank her. 

And it made me realize, omg, I never even sat down and thought about all the things, and more importantly people, I’m grateful for this year. Fortunately [Oscar Insurance](http://blog.hioscar.com/post/103736729575/we-are-thankful) reached out to me to ask me what I’m thankful about, and inspired me with the hashtag #WeAreThankful.

So let's talk gratitude: 

1. Family (and the fact they put up with me).
-------------

I convinced the family this year to do a 5k after the holidays. And even though my brother has a surgery coming up in the next few weeks, he was **still** down to do it. They definitely have my back.

2. Figuring out my health. 
-------------

Before this year, I had never run a half, a 10k, or even a real 5k. I hadn’t ever gone to yoga more than an errant time or two. I liked hiking, biking, and sports. But I avoided so many things for fear of being bad at them. This last year, I stopped worrying about looking silly trying something new.

3. Duh. J.
-------------

He actually coded most of this blog, takes a bunch of the pictures, and goes along with 90% of the things I do. (Still can’t convince him into yoga. :( ) He’s basically the coolest person I know. I haven’t killed him after a 3 week road trip, him teaching me to ski, or even after he told me I had a “pizza belly” a few nights ago. So basically it’s love.

4. This blog!
-------------

Sometimes (maybe most of the time) I’m a terrible blogger. I take bad quality iPhone pictures, neglect to post, and even sometimes let my comments build up forever. But this blog has also been the coolest thing ever. I take more pictures, I’ve tried new things, and I’ve met the most fun people ever just by being on the internet. I’m thankful for everyone who reads this, and all the really amazing ladies I comment back and forth with. You guys make the good old world wide web fun. :)

I’m thankful for a lot more things (like the good old job, the fact that I can get my hands on the ground in a forward fold, and that my eyeliner looks pretty darn good most days.) And it’s important to consider all the things we’re grateful for before we step into the busiest, and most consumeristic time of the year. (No judgement here, I’m straight up buying everything this Christmas.)

Even though we’ve already eaten all the turkey, cranberry sauce, and paleo pumpkin pie (j/k, maybe), what are you thankful for?
