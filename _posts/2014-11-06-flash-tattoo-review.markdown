Today has been one of those days where all I want to do is treat myself. I may or may not have signed up for a subscription box, bought new shoes, and considered the finer points of owning adorable, hand crafted, [cat-shaped mugs](https://www.etsy.com/listing/172817839/custom-text-cute-cat-mug-white-black) from Etsy. (I have yet to buy the kitty mugs, but give it a day.) 

While I love to get packages in the mail (does anyone not like getting packages in the mail?), I sometimes don’t love paying for all those packages. So my goal? Buy really cheap things I love, that still get mailed to me. All the good feelings, none--- less of the guilt. :)

So recently I bought a pack of [flash tattoos](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00O71O8XS) on Amazon.

Flash tattoos were everywhere this summer, if you watched basically any bad reality tv. They look amazing on a tan. But. Since I don’t have a tan at any point of the year. There’s no time like the present to hop on the bandwagon.

I impulse ordered a set from Amazon. They were 12 dollars for 5 sheets, and were prime eligible. So I got my greedy hands on them super fast.

Bam. All 5 sheets, with extra filters. For those of you who also can’t lay off the [instagram](http://www.instagram.com/kay_bueno).

My boss actually picked them up out of the mailroom for me, (The first 6 letters of our last names are identical. So his mailbox is next to mine) and asked what they were for. Having no shame, I told my boss (who is a super uncool, but amazing dad type), that they were temporary tattoos for adults. 

He laughed at me. 

So I started small for work wear. I went with these guys.

A little ring, and one of the teeny tiny flowers.

Now I won’t show you how to apply these guys, because it’s basically fool proof. Cut out the tattoo, pull off the plastic, stick it wherever, wet, and go. (Actually, for complete honesty. I would do this somewhere you’re hairless. I definitely may or may not have quickly removed some errant knuckle hairs before doing this).

I will tell you, full disclosure, that I definitely forgot to take off the plastic the first time I did this. Don’t forget that step. It ruins it. Womp womp.

I know you really wanted to see straight up my nose for this.

Lighting is hard guys. 

But! I swear it’s the end of too close for comfort selfies. It’s just really hard to photograph your fourth knuckle if you’re not like, posing for super cute engagement photos or something.

Great. Now that we all can pick my individual body parts out of a line up. 

They turned out pretty great. No one at work thought they were crazy, in fact, only two girls who stood in line for coffee noticed them. The staying power of the ring has been great. Unfortunately, the little flower-y dude has completely rubbed off. I do a lot of index finger work I guess…

All in all. I plan on buying more (if they still stay cool) to put alongside whatever else I make at  at Christmas and give to those girlfriends who maybe aren’t your bffs, but still are gift worthy. :)

And, at 5 pages of tattoos, for 12 bucks, in two days. You end up paying less than 20 cents a tattoo. Not bad Kay. Not bad.

What are you splurging (or saving!) on lately?

*Because disclaimers are cool. I wasn’t compensated in any way by the random Amazon company I bought these from. In fact, they probably don’t even know I’m alive.*
