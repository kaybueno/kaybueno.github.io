Our second day in Lake Tahoe, we didn’t want to kill ourselves with another hike, especially since we were snowed on the day before. Buuuuut, we both wanted to see balancing rock before we left.

We considered a few activities, kayaking, paddle boarding, zip lining, all the watersports were closed until Memorial Day. I really, really didn’t want to zipline. I thought it’d be super boring, since we did it in Costa Rica. But I caved in, and let J book it. We ended up getting a two for one deal though, and hell, I like coupons. :)

J’s knees hurt, and it didn’t look like the gate to balancing rock was open. So we parked in a little outlet nearby. OMG. Best decision ever. It was like less than half a mile to the site. We ran around and took pictures. Since the rock entrance was closed, we were the only people there. Which made for a quiet morning.

When you’re at balancing rock though, it almost feels like it could fall on you. It didn’t, but it feeeeels like it could.

Speaking of things falling, I’m the clumsiest person ever. I totally bit it and fell hard on my hands and knees walking back to the car. At the time, it didn’t seem like a big deal, you know? I just fell. I’m an adult. I should be able to handle it. But as we got on the road, I realized that I was bleeding through my yoga pants. We picked up some bandaids and alcohol wipes and cleaned up before getting to the high ropes course.

Dude. It was insane.

Let me first point out that we were the only childless adults at the facility. But once we got past that, it was so cool.

Basically, they rigged up 5 different levels of treetop courses. They all involved some level of balancing, climbing, jumping, and zip lining. You would clip in and climb up a ladder, onto a platform, have to tightrope across to the next platform, and then skateboard in mid-air into a weirdly woven web that you climb across to a zipline. And repeat with a billion different challenges.

We did every single one of them. It was crazy fun. This was also the Sunday of Mother’s Day, so there were a lot of moms there. I felt really bad at some points because a lot of the moms, despite being in decent to good shape, were really afraid of failing at the courses, so they didn’t even try.

To be fair though, it was hard. The next day I was so sore, I wanted to puke.
