I've been making my daily batch of Soylent the night before. I’ve heard letting sit, makes the liquid less gritty, and also, it gives me more time in the morning to get ready. I’m lazy, so I just measure, blend, and then shove the entire blender in the fridge for the night. (minus the base, guys, I’m not an idiot.)

Doing this means I can wake up, re-blend for a second to reintegrate the oils that have separated (delicious) and go.

Sorry in advance for all the selfies. After yesterdays photos, I needed a lot of make up and good angles in today's post. :)

Day two was as easy, or easier than day one. I actually have a hard time finishing all the soylent by the end of the day. I need to drink more in the morning, because before Soylent, I most naturally ate the most during the day.

So far, no one in person has noticed or asked me about my kind of bizarre eating habits, which is really relieving, because honestly, I don't really want to explain. My suggestion for keeping it under wraps? I've been able to fit it all in a blender bottle, which you can see in basically every picture. So it's pretty small and inconspicuous. 

But, I'm still worried, I can't avoid lunch with the coworkers forever. Lately, I've been hoping to do non-eating activities during my normal lunch break. I figure walking, and yoga can replace my usual munching. Unfortunately, the last two lunches, I’ve just been doing work at my desk. Uggggh.

Overall though, I feel even, and happy not making choices. The last two days have been fairly stressful, and usually that would mean I’d be chomping my way through snacks and coffee at work. But I haven’t. I mean, I still drink coffee, tea, and other nearly 0 calorie beverages. But I’m not trying to binge my stress away.

It's silly but, I want magical results at day two, so then I’d feel like I have something great to tell you, or to write about. So far, I haven’t exercised heavily since drinking soylent, but I’m hoping to do a good run tomorrow and see how it goes!
