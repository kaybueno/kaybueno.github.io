Such a busy weekend! I have so much to catch up on in the blog world like a tag from [Tricia](http://acoupleofdashes.com/), like 8 posts from [Stephanie, aka ganeeban :)](http://girlytomboymusings.blogspot.com/) and recipes from all over. But! J returned home this weekend, and work has been absolutely swamped, so I’m slowly shoveling my way out.

This weekend, I started in Palo Alto for some retail therapy, and some acai. (It’s not a weekend anymore if I don’t at least try to consume acai.) I hit up [Bare Bowls](barebowls.com) and ate this delicious pitaya blend.

Bare’s portion sizes are way more reasonable, albeit still expensive. But I didn’t feel like I was consuming acai the size of my head. (But I have, and I will) The only sad thing, is I felt really old at Bare because it was all adorable Stanford students out studying or coming in from their morning run.

I stopped at Anthropologie (to admire all the spring dresses) but also to pick up some bowls that were more portion friendly. I’ve been trying to snack lighter lately, but putting a serving of nuts in a soup bowl just makes me feel like I’m not eating anything. These guys are way better (and cuter).

I demoed them with a serving of pretzels. Perfect!

I bought a few more things from Lululemon and Athleta, but I’ll spare you the awkward dressing room selfies. I’m a lazy treadmill runner, and I hope that by buying outdoor running clothes, I commit to occasionally running outdoors. Ha.

I picked J up that afternoon and basically smothered him with love and questions, but mostly questions. He had a blast, skied the alps, ate his weight in jamon iberico, and partied more days in two weeks than we normally do in a year. 

The next morning I was off to Alcatraz with friends. It’s one of the cooler tourist spots in SF, and we wanted to check out Ai Weiwei’s exhibit there.

Ai Weiwei is an activist from China who was detained by the country for 82 days for his belief. While he’s not currently in prison, he can’t leave China, so these exhibits are made in his studio and then shipped and set up in locations he’ll never see nor visit by other artists. 

The Alcatraz exhibit places carefree, child-like items like kites and legos, in a normally dark, gloomy place like prison in order to contrast the pieces with their overall location. Multiple artworks feature other prisoners and dissidents prominently.

It was a beautiful and haunting exhibit, and it allowed us to check out parts of the prison I hadn’t seen before. 

After ferrying back to SF, I walked to [Cassie’s](http://almostgettingittogether.com/) place to chat and drink a smoothie. It was a nice way to catch up, since I won’t see her this next weekend while I’m in Portland.

How was your weekend? Do you shop often? Any one else go from treadmill running to outdoor running?
