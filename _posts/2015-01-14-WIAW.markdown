This [Wednesday](http://peasandcrayons.com/2015/01/ate-wednesday-208.html) was brought to you by my cravings. It was a day I ate the things I was hungry for. Which worked out pretty well overall.

In the next few WIAW, I think I might experiment spending a day eating other popular diets. While I like the way I eat now, I think it might be fun to shake things up in the New Year. My work offers a lot of flexibility when it comes to vegan, paleo, raw, gluten free, etc diets, and while I have the chance I should try it.

The day started with a pretty standard cup of steel cut oats, I added, raisins, coconut, peanut butter, and a little bit of ground flax and cinnamon. Delicious, once I stirred it all together. But needed more protein. I was ravenous by lunch!

Lunch was slightly large. I had both a grilled chicken sandwich, and vegan broccoli-kale soup.

I was looking forward to the chicken when I ordered it, but I have to say, this soup was the star. Packed with vegetables, and a smooth consistency, you can bet I’m ordering this guy again.

So many snacks today! I’ve been eating my weight in satsuma mandarins lately. They are delicious. I had one with a little bag of pistachios. (Small win, this is the first bag of pistachios where I’ve been able to unshell every single one!)

And a little square of cheese. I love cheese, and have split entire cheese plates with others before. I’m always a little sad when I realize this is the serving size.

Old habits die hard. Also I had a really long yoga class that stretched past dinner. So when I biked home at 8 pm, I didn’t really want to do more than put a pot of popcorn on the stove.

Also unpictured, a cookies and cream quest bar. But! I kind of hated this. Did I eat this wrong? It was kind of slimy and the only redeeming quality was the cookie portion of this guy. I’ve heard people microwave and broil these, does that make it better?

What’s the best thing you ate all day? the worst? How do you eat a quest bar (if you eat them)?
