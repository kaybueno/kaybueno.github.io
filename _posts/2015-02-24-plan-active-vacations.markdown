No secret here, I spend a lot of time on [Google Flight Search](https://www.google.com/flights/) trying to find good weekend getaways. I enjoy a nice weekend at home, but if there’s the chance I can take a roadtrip, or hop a plane out of town, I’m the first to do it. 

One of the reasons I’ve been search, is my birthday is coming up, and J and I are heading north to Portland for the weekend. I realized, aside from planning to literally drown myself in coffee, most of the things I want to do are food related. So in order to minimize the damage, I’ve been thinking of how to keep active on vacation. 

1. Walk everywhere (if you can!)
-------------
I’m a huge proponent of walking. If it’s safe out, and I can budget the time, I always try to walk. When my sister and I were in Vegas, we explored all of the Strip, and inside a bunch of stores. Climbing 6 flights of stairs was worth both the steps, and the fun we had posing with M&Ms. Indoor or outdoor walking are both great ways to stay active.

2. Rent a bike, or go on a run to explore the city
-------------
One of our plans in Portland is to bike around town, but we’ve also loved biking in Hawaii, San Francisco, Monterey, and Boston. It’s a great way to see most of the city in a short amount of time.

3. Try Yelp for other extreme adventures. 
-------------
One weekend we went to Tahoe and found an extreme high ropes course. After two days of hiking this was a great way to mix it up. I love paddleboarding, beachfront yoga, and trampoline gyms when I’m away.

4. Find a nearby hike
-------------
This is one of my favorites. J and I actually spent 3 weeks getting from NYC to San Francisco by car because during the whole trip we kept stopping and hiking at every National park on our way.

5. Take a local class.
-------------
I love finding new classes in other cities, and with so many deals for your first class, or first week, it can be really budget friendly to take a class on vacation.

What are your favorite vacations? Do you stay active? Any tips? (Also what should I do in Portland that I’m missing. We only have two full days in Portland itself.)
