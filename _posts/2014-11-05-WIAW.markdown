Do you ever wonder what people will think of us in 500 years? I had this exact thought this morning. What would a cultural anthropologist a few hundred years from now think of the fact that every Wednesday, a bunch of people post stylized pictures of what they ate that day? 

In spite of the fact that researchers in the future will probably think I’m part of a weird food posting cult, and also judge me for eating packaged eggs. I’m still here to report on the things I ate on my Wednesday. 

Here goes breakfast. Coffee. Kiwi. And the Wilcox bag? That’s two hardboiled eggs. They’re delicious. Judge away.

Pardon the lunch shot. I’m still not quite comfortable announcing to my coworkers that I’m going to be photographing my food. But I made a grilled veggie and chicken sandwich and paired it with a macaroni and chickpea soup in a vegetable-tomato broth.

This apple doesn’t look anywhere to actual scale of an apple. But it was my post lunch snack.

Work brought around these cups of chia seed pudding. They were unreal. Diced mango, chia seeds, coconut milk, agave, and mint. Delicious. I may or may not try to recreate this it was so good.

It’s not dinner yet here. But I’ll probably snack on something at home. I’m not a big late meal person. I tend to sleep better when I eat less at night.

What's your current snacking fave? I'm looking for something new. All my summer snacks seem *so wrong* when we're approaching winter.
