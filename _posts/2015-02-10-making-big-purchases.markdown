I won’t lie, I’m someone who often employs retail therapy to make myself feel better. I love buying a box of new granola bars, or finding a cute candle or buying a new subscription box on an impulse. And, while I have a general budget, I do let myself roam pretty freely with small purchases. If I see something cute on etsy under 50 dollars, chances are, I’ll eventually buy it.

But when it comes to big purchases, for some reason it seems much more serious to me. I could buy ten, $10 products in a week, but one pair of $98 lululemon yoga pants makes me reconsider. Because of this, it can take me weeks to finally pull the trigger on expensive purchases.

When I look back to my time in San Francisco. There are two major purchases I’ve made, and today I made another. I wanted to look back and see if they were worth the weeks of deliberation I put myself through.

The first big ticket item I bought was my bike. J and I actually bought our bikes together. We had dreams of long scenic rides on the weekends, and fast trips throughout the city. We agonized over whether we should go road, mountain, or hybrid. We eventually both bought road bikes and it was like buying my first car all over again.

Fortunately, in terms of miles, the bikes have paid themselves off easily. I don’t own a car, and so I can either, bike, walk, or take an uber into work. Self powering my commute saves me ~12 dollars a day, and makes me more awake, alert, and happy. I love my Cannondale, and even after trying a more comfortable commuter bike, still want to stick with my baby.

The next year, my big purchase was my Canon EOS 7D. I had been wanting to take better pictures, and blog better pictures for awhile. I have quite a few friends who do photo walks, and always have gorgeous photos they’ve edited on Facebook. I researched for awhile to find an intermediate camera, and finally bit the bullet and bought this one.

It takes amazing pictures, even on auto. The first day it came in J and I did a pretty serious unboxing and started taking pictures around the house. It was like Christmas Day.

However, I feel a little guilty on this one. I still don’t know how to really use my camera. And when J leaves for a month of work trips, I plan on really improving this area so that I can better utilize this baby.

Which brings me to today. I had a Fitbit Force for the past year, and it finally broke from all the love and miles I put on it. In the past few weeks, I’ve been surprised at how much I missed step tracking, as a traditional office worker, it’s a really strong barometer for how my activity levels have been. 

After a lot of consideration. I purchased the [Fitbit Surge](https://www.fitbit.com/surge). I’m super excited about the new features, but it’s definitely taken me almost a month to get on board with buying it. It’s being delivered today, so I’ll let you know how I like it.

What’s the last big purchase you made? Do you think a lot of about big purchases, or small ones?
