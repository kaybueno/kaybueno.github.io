Road to Hana! Road to Hana! Road to Hana! 

Not to say it’s name too many times, but Road to Hana is one of my favorite parts about Maui. It’s a great reason to get a jeep, take the top off, and drive a few hours down a long windy road that goes to nowhere. (And buy, and consume a lot of banana bread along the way!)

So of course, J and I rented a Jeep (after a lot of begging on my part for a Jeep) and set out early on day 3 to embark on the Road to Hana. It’s a drive that could be done back and forth in one day, but J and I wanted to hike a bunch along the way, and do the Pipiwai trail at the Oheo Gulch. So we decided to spend a night in Hana. 

This was almost disastrous, as we planned this trip to Hawaii just the week before we flew here. And little did we know, the original day we planned to do Road to Hana, there was a huge foot race/relay on the route. (We’re talking thousands of people running on a one lane road) Thankfully, when we tried to book a hotel, the receptionist told us we were choosing the worst dates for this. Phew.

Road to Hana is a journey, filled with twisty passes and one laned bridges, and J and I didn’t want to go it alone. So we downloaded the Road to Hana GyPSy app on our phones. Though the narrator is a little cheesy, without him, we would have never stumbled across things like rainbow eucalyptus!

Which are, in my mind, the prettiest trees I’ve ever seen. (Take that cherry blossoms). We also ended up in Keanae. A quiet town with pretty black rock beaches. One of the great things about this narrated, GPS based tour, is that the narrator gives you five important things to do on the road. So there’s no analysis paralysis of trying to pick the best places to stop along the way.

At the end of the road, we stopped in Hana. We found a super cute hotel called the Hana Kai Maui (of no relation to the Mana Kai Maui). It was seriously one of the most, clean, modern places we stayed. It felt beachy without having that fake resort feel. And the kitchen was high tech. I wanted to live there forever.

Since we were on the east side of the island, I hopped into bed as early as possible so I could wake up and catch the sunrise the next day at 5:30 am. 

What’s the last adventure you took?
