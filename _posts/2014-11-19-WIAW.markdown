It’s [Wednesday](//www.peasandcrayons.com) again. And if I could describe my week in one badly taken selfie, it would probably look something like this:

A lot of times, when you see WIAW, you get the most beautiful food of someone’s day. And trust me, I’m going to give you that. But I’m also going to give you my not so great food either. (Although due to the fact that I literally snarfed it up as soon as I got my hands on it, no photo evidence exists.)

But let’s start with the good. My morning started with Pumpkin Chia Seed Pudding. I’m really feeling chia seed pudding, and I can make it the night before, so it works great. I’ll put up a recipe as soon as my camera is here. :)

The pumpkin version was… probably good if you love pumpkin. It tasted like pumpkin pie filling to me, but I realized, I’m not a huge “real pumpkin flavor” kind of girl. I want the fakey-fake pumpkin syrup taste. Ooops.

Lunch was amazing. Little tacos and a salad. They had chopped, roasted, delicata squash, and it was a great topper.

Lately, to get myself away from my desk, I go grab a spot of froyo. This was a pear-apple blend, with sprinkles for cuteness, and marshmallows because they taste amazing cold.

Mid-day snack. Some Oloves. Basically olives. They’re so good, and such adorable travel packs. I die.

Finally, a bowl of popcorn at home. Yum

And that would be a usual day, maybe add another snack, or fruit, if I didn’t discover a giant dispenser of 61% cacao, chocolate covered almonds at work. 

No joke, I probably ate like 30. 

So now I have a stomach ache, a really delicious stomach ache. And I need someone to wipe my brain so that I don’t know that these beasts are less than 10 minutes away from me. :)

Hahaha. Just kidding about the memory wiping. They were a good treat. But definitely a little over kill on the portion control. 

How was your week of eats? Is there some delicious delicious snack you can’t just have one of? What are you cooking lately?
