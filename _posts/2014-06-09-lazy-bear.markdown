Ever find something decidedly cool, from an incredibly uncool place? J and I found out about Lazy Bear, an underground dinner you sign up for lottery style a few months ago. After months of putting our names in, we finally were chosen for this many many course experience. We thought we were cool, and hip, and maybe read it in the New York Times, or heard it from a food loving friend. 

But no. It was Yelp. The number one rated “restaurant” in SF. Not so cool. The courses were all amazing, and there are so many, that I won’t describe every one in detail.

Let’s begin. I missed snapping photos of some of the initial courses, so, this is not representative of the full meal.
