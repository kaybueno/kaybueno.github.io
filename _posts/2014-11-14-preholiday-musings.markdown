Random things I’m thinking about lately.

1. Challenges
-------------

The year is ending, and I feel like it’s one of those seasons where I start thinking: “I should improve myself!”. I’m not sure if I want to take on a sleep goal, or shoot for weight loss, or train for something, or get more flexible or… And the problem is, I kind of want to do them all. I think it’s a mix of boredom and anticipating New Years and Holidays.  

Obviously evidenced by the picture below, I could use some biceps -- guns. :)

2.  Blogging induced baking urges.
----------------------------------

I made some mediocre pancakes last night. Pumpkin protein pancakes to be specific. (Yeah, I know, we’re over pumpkin. We just saw our 8th pumpkin muffin this week. But guys, I want to be on the bandwagon too) I mean, to be real with you, I haven’t been cooking much until this whole blog thing. But now that I see it everywhere. I have the urge to put things on my stove, and in my microwave,

3.  Christmas gifts
-------------------

So I have two siblings, an “adopted” sibling, my parents, my grandparents, my best friend, a handful of other friends, and my siblings’ and parent’s significant others. It’s unromantic and definitely not whimsical, but I’m going to need to make a spreadsheet soon of what I’m getting everyone. Christmas is in 40 days (or so) and that’s mind blowing.

Christmas last year, we all get themed pajamas every year!

4.  What should I be drinking
-----------------------------

I saw a lot of people drinking the celestial seasons holiday teas. And I thought, I want some of that. So I bought it. J is making fun of me because he only drinks tea that’s leaves. Secret. I probably drink a little too much diet soda, but, I gave it up for a year, and didn’t notice a difference, so I’m back on it. I figure sugar cookie tea can’t be that much worse for you than diet rootbeer.

Here's J and I drinking tea in the summer. It was pretty good despite the long face.

I snuck a cup this morning. Unsurprisingly it was pretty good. Even J admitted it wasn’t that overpowering.

What's on your mind lately? Are you the type of person who makes resolutions? What do you drink at night? Help a woman out. :)
