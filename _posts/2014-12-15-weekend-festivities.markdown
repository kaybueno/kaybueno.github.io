When I was a little kid, I had some serious expectations of who I’d end up as as an adult. I imagined have a seriously fabulous life, like the people (or let’s be real, characters) in most of the early 2000s reality shows. While sometimes, the inner 13 year old in me is sometimes disappointed my life didn’t turn out like Laguna Beach (the 24 year old in me is not disappointed. At all.), sometimes I have a weekend that makes me feel like my life is not too far away from a faked reality tv show.

It started with two Christmas parties. That looked something like this:

Or maybe this:

J’s party had that adorable gif making photo booth, on top of a taco bar, a slider bar, an open bar, and a cookie decorating bar. :) Full disclosure, I am a terrible, terrible gingerbread person decorator, but a wonderful gingerbread eater.

Unlike the celebs, this basic b wore the same outfit both nights. If I’m honest, it was even the same look both nights. I screenshotted a snap to cherish the moment. I’ll have even more crazy photobooth photos soon.

After downing cake pops, charcuterie, alcohol laden hot chocolate, and much much more. (Like, you don’t even want to know how much more). I realized I needed to get off the holiday party buzz with some serious sweating, and healthy eating. So I signed myself up for a local 5k the morning after our second holiday party.

Best idea ever. The race was a serious blast, and I completed in a pretty reasonable time for a still kind of boozy 5k. 27:50. After the run, I hopped in the car with [Cassie](//www.almostgettingittogether.com), and we met [Gina](//www.instagram.com/ginamarie_hlc) for brunch and a stroll around the dish.

Last, but not least (and possibly most delicious). The girls and I grabbed freezes at Pressed Juicery. Their vanilla almond milk, made into a smooth frozen yogurt, is maybe the best thing I ate all weekend, even including the cake pops. 

I literally want to eat this every day.

How was your weekend? Do you have any holiday party plans?
