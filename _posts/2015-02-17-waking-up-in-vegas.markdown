Hey all. Sorry I’ve been so MIA. I spent the weekend with my sister in Vegas watching the [USA Rugby Sevens](http://www.usasevens.com/las-vegas/). Embarrassingly, this international tournament is the first time I’ve actually watched rugby, despite the fact that my sister has played it for almost 4 years now. (Yes. I am really the worst.) But we had a lot of fun, the seats were amazing, and the games were great.

For Christmas, I shelled out for seats right behind the try (the goal posts) and we watched with some of the biggest fans in Rugby. The row of gentlemen behind us were ex-pats from England, and I basically fell in love with them for their cheers. 

If anything was good it was “Get it lads!” or if one of the England players missed a pass, “Oh what a muppet!” and when France played England I heard choruses of “The only reason France plays Rugby is for another excuse to wear Spandex.” or “No wonder France is trying Rugby, they don’t have anything they’re good at anymore now that California makes the best wines.” The kid sister and I couldn’t keep from cracking up.

We stayed at the team hotel, so we were constantly surrounded by giant rugby players. In the casino, at the bar, in the pool. It was a blast to feel like part of the team.

We made our way around Vegas in the two days we had off.

My suggestions? Drink all the novelty drinks. Explore all the stores. Walk the strip about 100 times. :)

My secret though? I’m terrible at Vegas. I’m not much for gambling, clubbing, smoking, or strippers. I like keeping my money, and that’s hard to do in Vegas. To be fair, we couldn’t stay out very late, because in order to get the best seats, we had to be at the field at 8 am. It was fun to visit for a weekend, but I would have been pretty bored if we were there much longer.

Have you been to Vegas before? What’s the most obscure sport you follow? 

*I’m catching up on all my blogs this week after having no service for five days. Sorry if I kill you with comments, likes, or love.*
