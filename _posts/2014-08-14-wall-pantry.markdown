I live in a teeny tiny apartment, my kitchen is probably the size of a lot of people’s closets. And as such, there are only a few small cabinets for storage. So when you receive 40 pounds of food at once, you have to, as Tim Gunn would say, make it work.

This wall has become my make shift pantry.

I had no idea what to expect size wise with soylent. And so, I shipped soylent to myself at work, (it would have gotten nicked from my door), not realizing that each week is about 10 pounds. So I’m delivered this pallet of soylent that I have to haul down stairs, across the parking lot, and then up to my apartment. When I finally made it to the apartment, I was covered in sweat and basically looked like a cartoon character shoving my soylent up the last few steps.

Speaking of work, I have a favorite mirror for selfies there. I love it, it’s super flattering, and really really large. But the situation’s a little awkward, because in order to maintain looking professional amongst my coworkers I have to make sure I snap the picture when no one else is there. So I’m always awkwardly looking around making sure the coast is clear and then posing like an idiot.

This weekend is so crazy. I have a friend coming to stay with me for 2 weeks, and she missed her birthday. So I wrapped up a bunch of small things. Then we also have a wedding, an ikea trip, and a bunch of touristy stuff to drag my buddy to. 

I’m never going to get any sleep!

What’s your weekend looking like?
