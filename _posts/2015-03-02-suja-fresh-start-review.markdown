So, I’m on the third day of a 3 day cleanse from Suja. But having made it through most of the way, I figured I’m now qualified to show you what a day in the life of my cleanse looked like, and weigh in on what I loved, hated, and everything inbetween.

For direct numbers, the Original Fresh Start is 6 juices a day, 3 green, two “root” and one nut milk. It clocks in at 1060 calories, so low, but not excessively. It expects you start the juices an hour or two after you wake up, and finish 3 hours before bed.  

Every morning starts the same with a mug of hot water, with a capful of apple cider vinegar, and a squeeze of lemon.

This is by and large my least favorite part of the day, and unfortunately, something I’ll probably take from the cleanse. I’m not convinced that warm lemon and apple cider vinegar is some miracle drink for weight loss, or health. But the potential for benefit outweighs the 3 terrible minutes of drinking this.

**Breakfast:** aka Glow. It’s a green juice, but is mostly apple-y to me. It’s easy to drink and low calorie. It’s a nice way to stop the morning after that terrible ACV-lemon combo. I usually started drinking this around 9 am.

**Mid-morning Snack:** is Fuel, although honestly. It’s not one of those things I feel fueled by, however it is delicious. Carrot heavy with apple, pineapple and lemon. 11 am is a hard time for me, so this is a nice juice to snack on.

**Lunch:** Purify. A seriously beet-y juice. It’s also really delicious, but I wish I had a more greens heavy juice in the morning. All three of the above juices clock under 100 calories per 8 oz serving.

**Midafternoon Snack**: Fiji. It’s very very similar to me to Glow. But I’m happy for the greens. This one only has a handful of leaves and is light from the celery and cucumber.

**Dinner:** Be still my heart. It’s Green Supreme. This is by far my favorite Suja juice from this set. And honestly, if I kept drinking any juice it would be this bad boy. He’s a lemon, kale and apple hybrid. But the kale is potent in this drink. This juice makes you feel healthy.

**Dessert:** Every review I’ve read tells you how much they love and look forward to the nut milk drink at the end of the night. And I’m here to end that. I didn’t love it. It was gritty, and not that creamy. It’s not unappealing, it’s just not anywhere near as good to me, as any of their other juices. If I was doing this cleanse again. I’d feign a nut allergy and double up on another juice.

My only other indulgence? Caffeine free tea. I don’t like flowery herbals, so this rooibos chai has been great for someone who loves black coffee and dark heavy teas.

Overall, I’ve got a lot of love for this cleanse. It’s my first, and honestly, it was pretty easy. I think the level of calories kept me satiated. The juices were fun to drink (but definitely taste healthy. This is no Welchs or Tropicana) and honestly, I felt very hydrated and I’m pretending my skin looks better, so I feel good.

I also think 3 days is basically the perfect amount of time to juice. I had a relaxing weekend, and you’re pretty dependent on the juice schedule, so it’s really key to be able to stick to a plan. For most people this would be great at work, but for me, it’s kind of embarrassing. Food is provided at work, and most of my coworkers are men who have never even heard of a cleanse. 

To do the work thing, I got a cute igloo lunchbox and buried four of my juices in it. It’s been great.

**The hardest part:** For me? No coffee. I drink a large cup of black coffee every morning at the same time. And so to go without any caffeine left me with crazy strong headaches the first morning. 

**The best part:** Not thinking about food all the time. It’s a little bit bizarre, though I knew I was doing a cleanse, I’d have these momentary “Indian food sounds really good for dinner” or “I should eat some bean chips before they go stale.” Even though I knew I was doing a juice cleanse, I thought about food. Which showed me how much of my day I spend with food on my mind.

Will I do it again? Probably yeah. Another time J’s out of town, or before my brother’s wedding. The Core Fresh Start by Suja is more intense and I’d love to try it because this was relatively easy for me to do.

Have you juiced? Do you drink green juices often? Is there a way to make apple cider vinegar suck less? :)
