No real update today babes. I had one of those days at work where you’re cranking things out so hard that you don’t realize you’ve been there ten hours. 

The weekend is going to be a straight up blast though. Women’s Health 10k, on Sunday, and Bridge School Benefit too. 

The only adorable part of my day came in the form of lunch. Work was celebrating breast cancer awareness. So they did a beet paper (pink) wrapped sushi roll. With a salad, and some indian inspired cabbage dish, they were a pretty fantastic lunch.

How was your weekend shaping up? Any major plans?
