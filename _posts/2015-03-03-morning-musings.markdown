With J gone for a few weeks (although, I got him to change his flight and come home earlier!!!), my schedule has been a little shaken up. Normally, we wake up around 8, maybe 9, and stumble on a bus, or a bike all the way into work.

Lately, I’ve been waking up at 5-6 a.m., and it’s amazing. I’m in love with the early morning, and I’ve been walking to work. (partially because my bike is in the shop, partially because I prefer walking.)

It’s fun to shake up your schedule, and I love that walking makes me feel more energized throughout the day. This morning I snapped a bunch of pictures along my way, so you could see my morning walk.

It’s a little chilly in the mornings, early to mid 40s. But it’s nothing a sweater can’t handle. (Sorry cold parts of the world.)

When I leave before 7 a.m., all the little kids are biking to school, and it’s adorable to see parades of kids on little, neon-colored bikes. However, I have morals, I think it’s weird to snap pictures of unassuming kids and post them on the internet.

This and a coffee is really the perfect way to wake up in the morning. 

How do you wake up? Do you pass anything great on your way to work?
