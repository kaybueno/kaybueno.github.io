	<p>Growing up in the midwest, I’m not particularly accustomed to seafood outside of fish, and maybe shrimp in a cocktail. </p>

<p>So when a good friend was having her birthday at a state park, two hours north of San Francisco, where the plan was to shuck oysters. I was pumped! </p>

<p>And petrified. I’ve never taken a shell off of anything more than a hermit crab.</p>

<p>The location was beautiful. To be fair, every beach in California is beautiful, but Point Reyes really has some amazing shoreline views. J and I hiked (if you can call it that) up a short paved cliffside road to watch some surfers and enjoy the view before the other party-goers got there.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-rkS27TFvE80/VEMFAEjwjGI/AAAAAAAAMEA/6ZcpuIdQzFk/w955-h716-no/IMG_3942.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>About 20 people came, a pretty good turn out for a seaside birthday. Unfortunately, the most familiarity anyone in the group had with shucking oysters was a few YouTube videos. </p>

<p>However, both sea otters and gulls are pretty good at getting oysters open. So we figured a few 20 somethings with knives couldn’t do too poorly.</p>

<p>After success with the first mollusc, everyone wanted to get their hands on one.</p>

<p>We had 100 oysters, a bunch of sides, and some gorgeous picnic tables laid out by the beach. Turns out, even for a midwestener, getting oysters out of their shells isn’t very difficult, and eating them fresh with a little lemon and hot sauce is one of the best things ever. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/fPGy6Vpys5B7JjxUXCEFc6tucdn4zEmWGCRq990SbUE=w570-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Friends, sun, sand and sea were the perfect way to spend a Saturday morning.</p>

<p>How’s your weekend going? Try anything new recently?</p>

	<p>My mailbox has had a pretty awesome week of packages, and so I wanted to share all the great things I got this week.</p>

<p>My team at work just launched, and so to celebrate we got t-shirts (and also went out for beers and appetizers.). Usually, shirts from work are the type of thing you only ever want to wear to sleep, or work out in. This one actually looks kind of okay (if you disregard the serious duck face I’m giving. Haha.)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7nCyC0pfUJ8/VEG80m0NoCI/AAAAAAAAL-o/FgfKRu6LAYY/w537-h716-no/IMG_3903.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>I am an addict for subscriptions, and one of the lesser known ones I love is <a href="http://footcardigan.com/">Foot Cardigan</a>. They send you an adorable pair of socks monthly. Both J and I have a subscription, and they’re awesome because, who doesn’t wear socks? Granted, few people see them except when I’ve got my pants cuffed to bike to work.</p>

<p>This month’s festive pair is so adorable though. ;)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/nBAuTLZjZ6GfkDFcivjSZCnIpj9KdQEBJL0OOyrkTp8=w955-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>I buy waaaaay too many cards. While I keep pretty light on spending usually, I am basically a card hoarder. Fortunately, it comes in handy when you find out you’re going to a birthday with only a few days notice. This one is super adorable and kitschy. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-YgTuE4yHgWw/VEHaHV3thKI/AAAAAAAAL_U/bX2TQQ9P_Og/w537-h716-no/IMG_3912.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Last, but not least. Shoes! </p>

<p>When I was in first grade and a student wore new shoes to class, the teacher would let you stand on your desk, and then almost as if singing happy birthday, or saying the pledge, all the other students would say in tandem “Ooooh, ahhhh, neeeew, shoooes.” It was a great way to start a healthy shoe addiction young.</p>

<p>These are the VivoBarefoot ones. The boyfriend has been super into minimalist traveling, and so he convinced me into trying a pair of barefoot shoes. They’re incredibly light, and only have a 4 mm base, which makes me less of a giant. I’m pretty addicted to my Mizunos, but I’ll be giving these a try this week. It&#39;s definitely a different feel from cushy shoes.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ZzorMvSvpTfghrp1YUCjHRib13P58-OTia5PT153FO8=s672-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Any big plans for the weekend? Got any faves from this week?</p>

	<h1><a href="/10-16-2014/woah-fall.html">Woooah, it's fall.</a></h1>

	</div>
	<p>Up until today, my life still felt like summer. California has been bright, sunny, and warm. I had yet to bundle up in anything more than a t-shirt. Heck, even the trees were still bright green.</p>

<p>But today, that all changed! Now, it’s unquestionably fall. And it all began with a pumpkin.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-zyYtyfJV3M0/VECHHx2RjqI/AAAAAAAAL4o/jKQ34uBCFcE/s716-no/IMG_3896.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>A 1600 pound pumpkin for that matter. Someone had delivered it to the office, and it was as tall as me (and I’m 5’10”.) And just… giant. All I could think of is how many muffins, scones, and spice lattes you could make with that sucker. Delicious.</p>

<p>Then, at lunch, I got roped into (read: I totally volunteered for) making decorations for my company’s Halloween party. It’s Alice in Wonderland themed (isn’t that the best? Spooky and whimsical without being cliche). So today I helped fold some of 800 paper roses.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-e0VbHCYZ4pU/VECHK6cMIyI/AAAAAAAAL7A/h9EWMwH_OWY/w955-h716-no/IMG_3894.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ZF2V5EM3i-8/VECHMOCKi6I/AAAAAAAAL60/68CytVOVMYg/w756-h716-no/IMG_3895.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Folding was a nice break from my typical daily work. The directions were super easy, and surprisingly, despite a bunch of us all working at once, the flowers turned out great. <a href="http://pldevents.com/how-to-paper-flowers/">This</a> is basically exactly what we did. Everyone at the table kept remarking that it felt like they were crafting for their wedding all over again, and how much they missed the DIY aspect of planning for it. By lunch end, we had knocked out about 100. The Queen’s maze is going to look great.</p>

<p>Decorating for Halloween and giant pumpkins started getting me in the fall mood. But then I walked into yoga tonight, and the class door was open to the outside, and it was freezing. Finally the temperature was telling me something. It’s fall.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-EZoSRD1DDwo/VECHNSPdIFI/AAAAAAAAL6k/43k4kG1bioA/w999-h716-no/IMG_3897.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>We closed the door and got to class. This yoga is called “Creative Yoga and Flow”, and it&#39;s the first yoga class I ever took. The first time I took from this instructor, when she was fixing my form, she gasped and cried out (to the entired class) “You need yoga! Your muscles are so tight. You work out too much with no yoga.” While simultaneously flattering (I work out!) and embarrassing (omg did everyone hear that), her class has been great for me to deepen my stretches in the basic poses. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-_bgZZCOtseE/VECHQI9fotI/AAAAAAAAL6s/_KwG6uo6btk/w906-h716-no/IMG_3899.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>As you can see, I’m ready with my mat, block and strap, well before the class starts. I can’t lie, I like to be on time. But my biggest pet peeve, is people who walk in late. 5-10 minutes late? Totally fine. 30-45 minutes late in an hour and fifteen minute class. Ridiculous. By that point, I’m in the middle of class, holding a pose, and the student who just walked in is asking me to move. Totally throws me off. </p>

<p>How’s your day been? Feeling fall? And what’s your biggest pet peeve?</p>

	<h1><a href="/10-15-2014/hawaii-end.html">Hawaii Day 6 - The end of Hawaii :(</a></h1>

	<p>On the Big Island, we stayed in the cutest B&amp;B right outside Volcanoes National Park. Bamboo Orchid Cottage is basically a giant house buried in the middle of (what feels like) the rainforest. The owner is fantastically fun, and takes great care of the place, when we came in after hiking, the fireplace was lit, a soothing CD was on, and the room smelled amazing. </p>

<p>But my favorite part was the breakfast:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/tNAA6yV3qOsxM6g69jd01eCI6kOJrwSlnqU3OxhtkZA=w845-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>The owner made us all lobster shaped papaya boats! The fruit on Hawaii was so fresh that I could have eaten two of these every morning. So delicious. My other favorite (and one of the only things I bought in Hawaii) was this adorable running shirt.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/D5jpeMh3ztJPMks3VI0dszMP2Eng2_wQ101seD9I8lM=w537-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>The store was so cute, and when we walked by I had to run in and have it. Had to. I can’t wait to do a race in this sucker.</p>

<p>We spent some time hiking Akaka Falls, hiking is a strong word as it’s just a tiny loop. But unlike in Maui, the falls here had water! It was a beautiful destination, but be warned, they make you pay to enter, even if you don’t park in their lot.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-9-OrUfrB19o/VB9JRklLUkI/AAAAAAAAJkU/6BGtZ7pmXRw/w537-h716-no/IMG_3665.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>J and I hit up some other scenic points. They were nice, but I was tired, and not feeling so well. Fortunately, J took picture duty.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Thf3Fx1KeTs/VB9KAKcFcPI/AAAAAAAAJpI/VrBkFNSz3gw/w955-h716-no/IMG_3691.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/--11jUmZu2b0/VB9J3dcDe7I/AAAAAAAAJoM/6w8b-l1FD4c/w955-h716-no/IMG_3686.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>We flew back to Maui, since we were departing from there, and checked into our hotel. I was only feeling worse, so we ordered room service. It was my first room service ever. I took a picture, even if I didn’t really eat any of it. :/</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-L0gQwEkZRFk/VB9KHcqc6RI/AAAAAAAAL4A/nfZ3Xn7Tf5c/w955-h716-no/IMG_3696.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Still feeling ill the next morning, I sent J out to our snorkel reservation. I was bummed I missed it, but his pictures are too amazing not to post.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-C5ZA5-W-bGg/VB-pn-hEewI/AAAAAAAALbU/-Kc0N2h_T-A/w1038-h688-no/turtle-head.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>We flew home that evening. It was an amazing trip, and we really got to enjoy good weather, and no internet connection (a lovely break from the all the time internet connection we have). J and I definitely hope to go back seeing as we’re closer to Hawaii than NYC now. :)</p>
