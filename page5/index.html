	<p>I think all I’ve been doing lately is working, sleeping, and signing up for races.</p>

<p>One of the reasons I keep signing up, is to keep myself running. So I want to pad out my races to approximately one a month. I&#39;m almost covered until the end of the year. But it&#39;s a little spotty in some places. I like doing races that (generally) don&#39;t require fundraising, don&#39;t have colors thrown at you, or zombies, or photoshoots, aren&#39;t super religious, and are relatively fun. With that said, here’s what I’ve got so far.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-YpDOnJqE-Fk/VBPgFDi14yI/AAAAAAAAIMA/FtNav66dzZ8/w650-h350-no/Screen%2BShot%2B2014-09-12%2Bat%2B11.04.49%2Bpm.png" alt=""></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://run10feed10.com">Run 10 Feed 10 - October 2014</a></strong></p>

<p>A philanthropic 10k put on by Women’s Health. I’m super excited because I’ll get to run over the Golden Gate Bridge. (I’ve only ever driven under it. Ooops)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-mAseAeTd5H8/VBPgFNSDXII/AAAAAAAAIMI/vfH8SS9S7wA/w650-h580-no/Screen%2BShot%2B2014-09-12%2Bat%2B11.05.21%2Bpm.png" alt=""></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://theuglysweaterrun.com">Ugly Sweater 5k - November 2014</a></strong></p>

<p>My family’s celebrating Thanksgiving with the ugliest 5k of all. I’m super pumped for this 5k. Both to run alongside (and beat) my siblings. But also because I’ve put together the most hideous Christmas apparel of all time!</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ABozaaNUJpw/VBPfI5BY7gI/AAAAAAAAILM/kkfAvpWU7OU/w679-h177-no/Screen%2BShot%2B2014-09-12%2Bat%2B11.06.01%2Bpm.png" alt=""></p>

<p><strong><a href="www.hotchocolate15k.com">Hot Chocolate 15k - January 2015</a></strong></p>

<p>I chose this race because a 15k is like the lazy man’s half. And I’m lazy. And it’s super flat. And there’s chocolate at the end of it. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-PLYtiwGpx90/VBPfJf2VfcI/AAAAAAAAILQ/welfgHWRpFk/w711-h350-no/Screen%2BShot%2B2014-09-12%2Bat%2B11.06.51%2Bpm.png" alt=""></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.seawheeze.com/">SeaWheeze Half - August 15, 2015</a></strong></p>

<p>But I got tickets! A race I love so much, I signed up a year in advance. This was literally one of my best experiences this year. It sold out in under a half hour, but both my mom and I managed to sign up.</p>

	</div>
	<p>Things have been a little crazy here. Most notably this morning I signed both my mom and myself up for SeaWheeze 2015! Woo.</p>

<p>I was super excited for it this year.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/4WtimBfywF1VYbcARzGbXxdfiaif8Z0co0A3F0704Qk=w894-h205-no" alt=""></p>

<p>I wanted to recap my experience with Soylent so far. And hit up what I’ve loved, and what I’ve strugged with. Let me give you a week by week of how it’s been.</p>

<p><strong>Week 1</strong> - Stayed on Soylent all 5 week days. 1200 calories a day on Soylent, uncounted otherwise.</p>

<p><strong>Week 2</strong> - Horrible stressful week with only 1 day Soylent. Let’s not even talk about my eating habits. (I may or may not have gorged myself on a back of mallowcreme pumpkins.)</p>

<p><strong>Week 3</strong> - 2 days Soylent, 500 calories. 5 days muggle food with general moderation.  </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ZU9U9bjti_M/U-zkJH1cDUI/AAAAAAAAIEI/DCMplJYmIRw/w429-h416-no/IMG_2756.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>So what’s going on in my blender?</p>

<p><strong>The Good:</strong><br>
1) I’m recognizing that I have a super weird relationship with food. So when I’m drinking Soylent, it’s helping me get away from some of that. For example, when drinking an adequate amount of Soylent to the point where I’m not hungry. I get this feeling like “I deserve a snack.” Even though I am perfectly satisfied, I’m finding I reward myself with food, even though I didn’t do anything award worthy.</p>

<p>2) Soylent, when drinking it, is not unpleasant.</p>

<p>3) I get a lot more done on days with Soylent. I usually take a brief walk at lunch, clear my head. Finish work earlier, and have more time for activities in the evening.</p>

<p>4) When I drink soylent, I actively want less food days I’m not drinking soylent.  </p>

<p><strong>The Not-So-Good:</strong><br>
1) I feel like a jerk turning my team down for lunch daily, or not being able to meet up with a friend after work. I’m not ready to “out” my Soylent habits yet, so a 5 day spread wasn’t working for me.</p>

<p>2) Even though Soylent tastes great. I hate the way it smells, makes my house smell, makes me smell. It actively makes me not want to drink it, even though the taste, and general experience is great. I have this mental block before I take the first sip, where I think. Shit, this is going to be horrible.</p>

<p>3) Since meals are provided for me at work, this is actually more effort than not doing Soylent.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-uan3B8_4bp4/VAU1KjXdEkI/AAAAAAAAID4/FsGt0Lpv8Vs/w963-h716-no/IMG_3009.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>The food I&#39;ve been wanting to eat with coworkers.</p>

<p>So as you can see from my little week break down. I’m shaking it up and doing a 5:2 split. (5 days off, two days on). Which I may move up to a 4:3 split once I get back from vacationing in Hawaii next week. </p>

<p>I think the most important thing is to find a sustainable way to incorporate this into my life. Honestly, the 5 days on spread, it wasn’t fitting my lifestyle. So I’m trying a method that mimics intermittent fasting more. I’ve liked it (so far) more than fasting, because Soylent even at low calories, takes away any hunger or cravings.</p>

<p>What’s been working for you so far?</p>

	<p>Getting things done over this long weekend. My closet has been the ultimate mess since I moved in. I bought these cheap wire storage bins to store clothes. Spoiler alert, they didn&#39;t work. So I spent today re-doing my closet/dressing area. First order of business, get a real dresser.</p>

<p>I went to Ikea, even though every time I build a piece of their furniture I promise myself I will never ever go Ikea again. But then they&#39;re so cheap and easy that I forget the building hell, and I keep coming back. </p>

<p>Final product. I still need to hang some things for more color!</p>

<p>Have any fall cleaning planned?</p>

	<h2><a href="/8-29-2014/seawheeze-half-marathon.html">Seawheeze Weekend - Race Recap!</a></h2>

	<p>Looking back at SeaWheeze, my only wish is that I would have taken more pictures. Because, the more I think about it, the more I realize, everything we did there was beautiful. Our B&amp;B (O Canada House) was this amazingly cute Victorian, with fancy plated breakfast, yummy pastries, cute puppies, and the sweetest owner. The weather was perfect all 3 days, the scenery was gorgeous. Really, you couldn&#39;t have asked for a better weekend.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I&#39;m not perfect, so I mostly gawked at everything around me, and didn&#39;t snap near enough photos. After my mom and I hit up the Showcase Store, we went to pick up my race package. :)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/K0COu1cmh3Hs31a86jn8F_fWN80FTY_1Fa_J_6N3dhM=w668-h672-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Talk about no line, we waited maybe 5 minutes to get to a booth and grab the goods. My favorite part of the pack? The Chip Wilson race chip. And the water bottle that we got as swag. I was pretty tired from the early morning, so after getting everything we went back to the B&amp;B, grabbed breakfast, napped, and walked back to the convention center to check out (but not participate in) yoga.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/XTH938gCtrZco3VsTXWPxJyCFGAdV6fDU4WL9MfM3_I=w875-h672-no" alt=""></p>

<p>It was surreal to watch a few hundred people doing yoga in the open air. As much as I wanted to join, I&#39;m kind of glad I didn&#39;t. I am out of yoga practice and would have been sore the next day. Which I&#39;ve heard isn&#39;t good when you&#39;re running a half marathon. </p>

<p>Speaking of. The next morning, I woke up at 4:30 (again...) to get in line for the half. Since it was my longest run ever, I was incredibly incredibly nervous about doing things right. I was nervous about eating at all before the race, and ended up just having a piece of pumpkin bread before heading over to the convention center. I took a picture in front of the brunch sign before running, so I&#39;m pretty sure I didn&#39;t deserve anything yet. (But at least I looked good at this point.)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-piiEleVflbs/VAFfqPTSJ0I/AAAAAAAAHys/hNLWjrrhgwE/w446-h621-no/seawheeze3.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>We were led through a really rousing warm up of jumping jacks and other light exercise. Unfortunately, the warm up was at least 50 minutes before my wave (1:10) made it to the starting line. So I&#39;m not sure it helped much other than to get me in the spirit of the run. It was super easy to find the pace beavers, and they pumped us up, and gave the whole wave tattoos to help track our times.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-vzR8vdAkztU/U_jP9OilNcI/AAAAAAAAHiQ/-UDU7R2l-oo/w537-h716-no/IMG_2893.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Unfortunately, I&#39;m bad at kilometers, so this wasn&#39;t very useful. But it did stay on, despite all the sweating. I was able to keep pace with the group until about mile 6. Where I started to falter. And by mile 9, I was ka-put. I was a little bummed, but since I had kind of slacked on my long runs right before the race, it&#39;s really what I should have expected.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the race was a lot of first timers half marathoners, so I wasn&#39;t the only one who got tired around this point. The worst part of faltering early was that the last few miles of the race are gorgeous. Runners are weaving around Stanley Park. But at this point all I was focused on was FINISH THE RACE and DON&#39;T DIE. So I hardly paid attention. </p>

<p>My mom was the best cheerleader though! She caught me at 3 of the cheering stations. Unfortunately photographing runners is both hard, and super unflattering. So here&#39;s an okay looking back-shot of me and quite a few other runners going around the water.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-LWw4Cc_78u4/VAFfp5BMnFI/AAAAAAAAHzA/RiCrw690Prs/w446-h639-no/seawheeze-2.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>But! I did finish, without medic nor dying. And coming in at 2:29 means that I&#39;ll definitely PR SeaWheeze 2015!</p>
