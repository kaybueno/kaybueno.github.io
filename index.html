	<p>Yay! <a href="http://peasandcrayons.com/2015/03/what-i-ate-wednesday-213.html">WIAW</a> is back!</p>

<p>I’m going to write today like it was the most delicious day ever, but that’s likely because it was the first day I ate after three days of juicing. Don’t get me wrong, the juice was great (and hey, I’m down 4 pounds [of mostly water weight]), but it’s nice to eat real food.</p>

<p>According to most cleanses, I did a terrible job eating after. I had a less than mediocre amount of vegetables, fruit, and light broths. But to me, today was great. I wasn’t craving things all day, and with my serious lack of cravings, I’ve been working on transitioning off diet soda. I felt wonderful, even if this isn’t what you should typically eat post cleanse.</p>

<p>The most unappetizing picture, but the most delicious breakfast. This was a sriracha, bacon, egg and cheese (on dutch crunch) sandwich with melon and apple.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-x75SPperI7w/VPcpN4tSZ-I/AAAAAAAAX5o/Cj1PDgQG-os/s1023-no/15%2B-%2B2" alt="breakfast"></p>

<p>Lunch there was a BBQ pop-up. I grabbed flank steak, roasted broccoli and whatever the salad was. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/CZ_EI7DYmsIn7jmbNHAWIl44g5B12hxjDsEU3Kvb1UyV=w1023-h665-no" alt="lunch"></p>

<p>I work at a magical place, where for no reason, someone will bring a skewer with tortellini, tomatoes, and cheese to your desk. It’s hard to say no to that.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/lSa26mEWIuHLrtlPUkpCIokqhhJfXV6xK6tCSRpmGjnU=w838-h1402-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Back to regularly scheduled snacks. I had a handful of pistachios. The best.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-pJzRLMaaQy4/VPcpN7et9DI/AAAAAAAAX50/Y0us7cFD0lE/w1023-h1364-no/15%2B-%2B5" alt="snack 1 pistachios"></p>

<p>And then later on some beef jerky. I love Fieldtrip a lot. I used to eat a lot of Krave Jerky, until my boyfriend pointed out it had more sugar than protein. Woops. Now I grab this guy. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/iIVi3C50voiHfflX2t2nDj93OB_u2OlThXPNpKRPqB5-=w1023-h1107-no" alt="snack two beef jerky"></p>

<p>I went on a run in the evening, so I wasn’t very hungry at dinner. I went home and watched the Bachelor Girls Tell All episode. (Guys, I’m so team Whitney. Sorry, not sorry.)</p>

<p>Literally 10 minutes before bed my stomach rumbled. So I grabbed a handful of “Pressels” a baked pretzel chip thingy I bought at whole foods on a whim. They’re a great snack that doesn’t make me want to immediately eat the entire bag. Yay for portionable things! And yay for the cutest chip clip ever.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ffxLDTlT7jo5CX6GbYISHVvu4P44cqGUfBSrCCmKTAi4=w1023-h1251-no" alt=""></p>

<p>What have you been eating lately? Are you watching the Bachelor? (I am the least big fan of Chris Soules, but I love (almost) all the girls this season.)</p>

	<p>With J gone for a few weeks (although, I got him to change his flight and come home earlier!!!), my schedule has been a little shaken up. Normally, we wake up around 8, maybe 9, and stumble on a bus, or a bike all the way into work.</p>

<p>Lately, I’ve been waking up at 5-6 a.m., and it’s amazing. I’m in love with the early morning, and I’ve been walking to work. (partially because my bike is in the shop, partially because I prefer walking.)</p>

<p>It’s fun to shake up your schedule, and I love that walking makes me feel more energized throughout the day. This morning I snapped a bunch of pictures along my way, so you could see my morning walk.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-7CnDhwX-RRw/VPXcOBtRq3I/AAAAAAAAX0Y/XYcPVyjW5nA/s1023-no/IMG_7394.JPG" alt=""><div class="caption">A lonely Google bike left on the side of the road.</div></p>

<p>It’s a little chilly in the mornings, early to mid 40s. But it’s nothing a sweater can’t handle. (Sorry cold parts of the world.)</p>

<p>When I leave before 7 a.m., all the little kids are biking to school, and it’s adorable to see parades of kids on little, neon-colored bikes. However, I have morals, I think it’s weird to snap pictures of unassuming kids and post them on the internet.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/1_XgkHSqFYv80hHfOj3QpvYYk3cBJm51lxCvp5ZSdHJP=w1023-h1159-no" alt=""><div class="caption">So you get flowers instead.</div></p>

<p>This and a coffee is really the perfect way to wake up in the morning. </p>

<p>How do you wake up? Do you pass anything great on your way to work? </p>

	<h1><a href="/3-2-2015/suja-fresh-start-review.html">Suja Original Fresh Start Program Review</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		March 2, 2015
	</div>

	<p>So, I’m on the third day of a 3 day cleanse from Suja. But having made it through most of the way, I figured I’m now qualified to show you what a day in the life of my cleanse looked like, and weigh in on what I loved, hated, and everything inbetween.</p>

<p>For direct numbers, the Original Fresh Start is 6 juices a day, 3 green, two “root” and one nut milk. It clocks in at 1060 calories, so low, but not excessively. It expects you start the juices an hour or two after you wake up, and finish 3 hours before bed.  </p>

<p>Every morning starts the same with a mug of hot water, with a capful of apple cider vinegar, and a squeeze of lemon. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/0ZGrIYlBunM7Z-FZEsqT-K6yxYTZsZ3t4ZAHFBdJOyEq=w1023-h1085-no" alt=""></p>

<p>This is by and large my least favorite part of the day, and unfortunately, something I’ll probably take from the cleanse. I’m not convinced that warm lemon and apple cider vinegar is some miracle drink for weight loss, or health. But the potential for benefit outweighs the 3 terrible minutes of drinking this.</p>

<p><strong>Breakfast:</strong> aka Glow. It’s a green juice, but is mostly apple-y to me. It’s easy to drink and low calorie. It’s a nice way to stop the morning after that terrible ACV-lemon combo. I usually started drinking this around 9 am.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/kHqBaG5UX6AAzrhjaO6v2P4BefDyQiX3xmP3yb8KlVOo=w1023-h1252-no" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>Mid-morning Snack:</strong> is Fuel, although honestly. It’s not one of those things I feel fueled by, however it is delicious. Carrot heavy with apple, pineapple and lemon. 11 am is a hard time for me, so this is a nice juice to snack on.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/SinCVgv5sm7NXviIIubmyUNSrLUNy4iZMi72AX8mHz-7=w1023-h1221-no" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>Lunch:</strong> Purify. A seriously beet-y juice. It’s also really delicious, but I wish I had a more greens heavy juice in the morning. All three of the above juices clock under 100 calories per 8 oz serving.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Kr0-QQ70BBtrl0Co-Jeb43riv9L5_jCKyFHxHMtd9s2w=w1023-h1213-no" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>Midafternoon Snack</strong>: Fiji. It’s very very similar to me to Glow. But I’m happy for the greens. This one only has a handful of leaves and is light from the celery and cucumber.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-3tmccTm95zg/VPSB_7Jt3-I/AAAAAAAAXrc/vEyXvp85TAw/w1023-h1364-no/15%2B-%2B6" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>Dinner:</strong> Be still my heart. It’s Green Supreme. This is by far my favorite Suja juice from this set. And honestly, if I kept drinking any juice it would be this bad boy. He’s a lemon, kale and apple hybrid. But the kale is potent in this drink. This juice makes you feel healthy.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-sqfwlrJQwgU/VPSB_7EFBJI/AAAAAAAAXrQ/7AL646_bSgw/s1023-no/15%2B-%2B7" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>Dessert:</strong> Every review I’ve read tells you how much they love and look forward to the nut milk drink at the end of the night. And I’m here to end that. I didn’t love it. It was gritty, and not that creamy. It’s not unappealing, it’s just not anywhere near as good to me, as any of their other juices. If I was doing this cleanse again. I’d feign a nut allergy and double up on another juice. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/B6gDpwogpLng7McjHqUb3rFTF6vp_O75fD2BjP9K4LIF=w1023-h1142-no" alt=""></p>

<p>My only other indulgence? Caffeine free tea. I don’t like flowery herbals, so this rooibos chai has been great for someone who loves black coffee and dark heavy teas.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/niBmtNxt8rNpSDBCuaHLh41OL1Arb41GknugGfABduCn=w1023-h1051-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Overall, I’ve got a lot of love for this cleanse. It’s my first, and honestly, it was pretty easy. I think the level of calories kept me satiated. The juices were fun to drink (but definitely taste healthy. This is no Welchs or Tropicana) and honestly, I felt very hydrated and I’m pretending my skin looks better, so I feel good.</p>

<p>I also think 3 days is basically the perfect amount of time to juice. I had a relaxing weekend, and you’re pretty dependent on the juice schedule, so it’s really key to be able to stick to a plan. For most people this would be great at work, but for me, it’s kind of embarrassing. Food is provided at work, and most of my coworkers are men who have never even heard of a cleanse. </p>

<p>To do the work thing, I got a cute igloo lunchbox and buried four of my juices in it. It’s been great.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/om_6CvoiX8zVDJo0-qGlwElSfQXyEmzAMduVyxRvBqFK=w1023-h912-no" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>The hardest part:</strong> For me? No coffee. I drink a large cup of black coffee every morning at the same time. And so to go without any caffeine left me with crazy strong headaches the first morning. </p>

<p><strong>The best part:</strong> Not thinking about food all the time. It’s a little bit bizarre, though I knew I was doing a cleanse, I’d have these momentary “Indian food sounds really good for dinner” or “I should eat some bean chips before they go stale.” Even though I knew I was doing a juice cleanse, I thought about food. Which showed me how much of my day I spend with food on my mind.</p>

<p>Will I do it again? Probably yeah. Another time J’s out of town, or before my brother’s wedding. The Core Fresh Start by Suja is more intense and I’d love to try it because this was relatively easy for me to do.</p>

<p>Have you juiced? Do you drink green juices often? Is there a way to make apple cider vinegar suck less? :)</p>

	<h1><a href="/2-25-2015/WIAW.html">WIAW - Vegan before a Cleanse</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		February 25, 2015
	</div>

	<p>Between you and me, I’ve never done a juice cleanse before. I like eating, and I’m not always a fan of how juice cleanses are marketed. I think my liver does a fine job of getting rid of toxins, and I’m not sure I really need to detox anything.</p>

<p>But, I have wanted to try one, with a juice bar on every corner in SF, it’s hard to not wonder. And I don’t think my metabolism, and body are so fragile that 3 days of 1200 calories in juice will hurt much.</p>

<p>Cleanses are kind of expensive (even with the deal I used), and so I wanted to do it “right”. So this whole week I’ve been eating vegan, and getting progressively more restrictive with my diet. The makers suggest “you cut out alcohol, processed foods, excess salt, white flour and bread products, and refined sugar a day or two before the program and load up on fresh fruits and veggies.”</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Bpl8pAQtyQDPfkk6Eo-5t-sw0yZp_tCq13IGK3yMLkYo=s1023-no" alt=""></p>

<p>For breakfast I made some coconut chia seed pudding (coconut milk, chia seeds, a drop of agave), and sprinkled a bit of this granola on for crunch. Delicious.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-9U7954KSTq8/VO3mJkm1N7I/AAAAAAAAXfg/uOvZMDLg2A8/w1022-h767-no/IMG_7300.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Lazy lunch. A veggie sandwich with spinach, onion, tomato, avocado and mustard. And a tofu and tomato soup. I’m lucky that work labels all their vegan options, but man, it’s kind of difficult to find things that don’t feel like sides. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-fAteehmqwSU/VO3mKEjiZXI/AAAAAAAAXfg/G9zLuilI6_k/w1023-h767-no/IMG_7299.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Post lunch snack of coconut chips, and hot tea. I’ve been drinking a lot of herbal tea during this in order to cut down my carbonated beverages problem.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/FqGghkNq0zOSvryeynP5uWPEqfR8jNBAv4VJ4qdKTb6N=w1023-h1165-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Desk picture of these super delicious bean chips. They’re very reminiscent of doritos, complete with seasoning that ends up all over your hands. I really loved them.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bqsfjeWsL9gNhpQY6FzR_ExSJ8KkRjMnsLUqg7_vs6Mp=w1023-h994-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Black bean brownie bites I made from <a href="http://minimalistbaker.com/vegan-gluten-free-black-bean-brownies/">this recipe</a> but with coconut sugar instead of raw cane. I added the sprinkles when photographing otherwise they look like bean hockey pucks. They’re good, but they definitely taste “healthy”. Whenever people tell me their friends can’t tell the difference, I always wonder if they have really polite, or really healthy friends. I’d eat these at home, but I wouldn’t bring them to a party.</p>

<p>Unpictured are the handful of cashews I snarfed. I had a hard time with vegan food this time. I’m used to a lot of protein, and I think not having easy options for protein made me ravenous and freezing cold all day. I paired a small dish of the chia seed pudding with a brownie this morning for breakfast and feel much better. So I&#39;m just aiming to eat more beans, nuts and tofu today.</p>

<p>It’s fun to try vegan, especially while J isn’t around. </p>

<p>Have you tried a cleanse? What vegan food should I try out?</p>
