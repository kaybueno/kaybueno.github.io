	<h1><a href="/12-16-2014/sevenly-cause-box.html">Sevenly Cause Box Review where I tell you how much I loved it.</a></h1>
	<div class="metadata">

	</div>
	<p>I’ll admit, I kind of love subscription boxes. It seems backwards, not knowing what you’re getting when you pay for it. But, as an adult buying boring things like ziploc bags, and dishwasher liquid, sometimes, online shopping gets boring. So subscription boxes are the closest thing I can get to buying myself presents.</p>

<p>I’ve been loving <a href="sevenly.org">Sevenly</a> forever. They have the softest, most flattering shirts ever and they let me feel as if I’m helping people at the same time.</p>

<p>So when they launched a quarterly box of products that benefit good causes, not gonna lie I bought a year of it. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/VVMY7o2A5N-yFKHjazvYSSIjA8MFgEhWgf51wHmcrHY0=w1036-h716-no" alt="The box"></p>

<p>I got the box at work today, and it was a little beat up. But I&#39;m not one to judge a book by it&#39;s cover (at least when it comes to boxes I really really want to open), I am one however to take photos on a black background with a white blog. Ooops!</p>

<p>The first thing I got out of the box was a super cute pack of Thank You notes. They&#39;re printed in LA and gorgeous photos. But the best part is that it comes with a wax seal. If you get a random thank you in the next year, it&#39;s because all I want to do now is press wax letter seals now.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the unopened package.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/hsS7v61BGcSdmTxhFBqYapWJeVg9wBJ4bObuKppoQvcl=s716-no" alt="First package of thank you notes"></p>

<p>The four cards. They&#39;re post card format, I can&#39;t wait to send them. Although, I&#39;m not sure if anyone&#39;s thankful for cold weather scenes.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-3KAsUrBfwcE/VI-8cyvixNI/AAAAAAAARG4/_NmWDkJURqY/s716-no/IMG_5364.JPG" alt="Cards and the stamp"></p>

<p>And here&#39;s the stamp and wax up close. I love that the stamp says &quot;thx&quot;. But now I&#39;m going to want one for all my letters, not just my thank you cards. I&#39;ll have to find one with a heart, or a star, or my name, which might be a little self inflated.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/gZeM2EEF4SN4NdiwZiDgZHxCXHXpJNXYgFum1lcyzMSq=w895-h716-no" alt="Stamp pattern and envelope"></p>

<p>The next part of the box was the Sevenly Change for Charity jar. One of J and my&#39;s ultimate first world problems is that J hates having change in his pockets, wallet, car, etc. So I dump all the change in my purse. Last time I emptied my purse I had 17 dollars in coins in it. Now I have somewhere more reasonable to drop my change than empty candle jars. And I&#39;ll feel guilted into donating it. :)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-2CZlFZZi980/VI-8xCzounI/AAAAAAAARGA/dupxsBcYgGo/w800-h716-no/IMG_5381.JPG" alt="Cutest change jar"></p>

<p>An adorable handwoven scarf. I need more solid, plain scarves. When all your scarves have birds, or chains, or prints on them, they get harder to wear with other things. :) Love this one.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-xK0M_5B_f1s/VI-86R72lGI/AAAAAAAARGY/nddDfTPheWc/w799-h716-no/IMG_5397.JPG" alt="Scarf"></p>

<p>My favorite piece was a little tiny elephant necklace. I&#39;ve been wearing it already, it&#39;s the perfect length, and it sits super flat on my neck, which is so amazing. But. Elephants are my favorite animals ever. So this was basically made for me.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/PbeCMcJT32U7954ur7V2-OrWKw2qrm6kcgN45HEBnUsJ=w679-h716-no" alt="A little tiny elephant necklace"></p>

<p>A tiny purse I&#39;m going to use as a makeup bag for flights and traveling in between J and my places. It&#39;s much much prettier than it looks in the photos. And it&#39;s the perfect size for travel.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/dGh61TRQd-LR_M9-dH66pC2gtUMyNLJmcVKr-kzpZG88=w933-h716-no" alt="Little baby purse"></p>

<p>And last but not least, the snacks! Delicious little cacao nibs, and a glorified granola bar. They&#39;re both gluten free, and the nibs are delicious. The bar I&#39;m saving for my flight home for the holidays.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-fdt4YHAxw_I/VI-8sSU5NYI/AAAAAAAARF4/XnvxwSxofkw/w619-h716-no/IMG_5377.JPG" alt="Snacks"></p>

<p>Overall, this is one of the few boxes where I actually felt like the amount I paid was pretty well reflected in the final product. I&#39;ve seen a lot of make-up/beauty subscription boxes and while I love the idea, I just don&#39;t need another lip gloss, or face moisturizer. So the items in those boxes often end up being not worth the product for me. But I actually plan on using all the items in this one. Sorry friends, I won&#39;t be regifting. :)</p>

<p>I bought this myself, but Sevenly is cool. I just happened to really like it, and I love finding new subscription boxes, so I figured I&#39;d share it with you. :)</p>

<p>Do you subscribe to any subscriptions? (I also love <a href="http://www.footcardigan.com/">Foot Cardigan</a> and <a href="https://www.stitchfix.com/">Stitch Fix</a>) What&#39;s the best gift you&#39;ve gotten yourself?</p>

	<p>When I was a little kid, I had some serious expectations of who I’d end up as as an adult. I imagined have a seriously fabulous life, like the people (or let’s be real, characters) in most of the early 2000s reality shows. While sometimes, the inner 13 year old in me is sometimes disappointed my life didn’t turn out like Laguna Beach (the 24 year old in me is not disappointed. At all.), sometimes I have a weekend that makes me feel like my life is not too far away from a faked reality tv show.</p>

<p>It started with two Christmas parties. That looked something like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-GmXXmpKXm3o/VI8QlQ0TniI/AAAAAAAAQ3I/SunxVNHcRnI/w670-h447-no/7sutcy0774.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>Or maybe this:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-tTLFJjbVXLQ/VI8QlTCj6nI/AAAAAAAAQ3A/nvcLV5UmUnQ/w670-h447-no/7sutcy0780.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>J’s party had that adorable gif making photo booth, on top of a taco bar, a slider bar, an open bar, and a cookie decorating bar. :) Full disclosure, I am a terrible, terrible gingerbread person decorator, but a wonderful gingerbread eater.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/K7uLYS7RfS_ZJG4abwW4U1DoFOcHE392q1QGYvNawrAk=w914-h502-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Unlike the celebs, this basic b wore the same outfit both nights. If I’m honest, it was even the same look both nights. I screenshotted a snap to cherish the moment. I’ll have even more crazy photobooth photos soon.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Tq_KuR-OnYgeQwCAZqzehgHFM-G7FhW1h26p1VqX0hRD=w640-h1136-no" alt=""></p>

<p>After downing cake pops, charcuterie, alcohol laden hot chocolate, and much much more. (Like, you don’t even want to know how much more). I realized I needed to get off the holiday party buzz with some serious sweating, and healthy eating. So I signed myself up for a local 5k the morning after our second holiday party.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/XDsv8bsLY-fjdA0ZJKq3rz5Gp9N1LFhLkPhs0cpyZoD1=s915-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Best idea ever. The race was a serious blast, and I completed in a pretty reasonable time for a still kind of boozy 5k. 27:50. After the run, I hopped in the car with <a href="www.almostgettingittogether.com">Cassie</a>, and we met <a href="www.instagram.com/ginamarie_hlc">Gina</a> for brunch and a stroll around the dish.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/8rvnSNVpAi_aCCUiGo9vwRauDB9PCnVYDgSnCDTKrkP7=w527-h450-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Last, but not least (and possibly most delicious). The girls and I grabbed freezes at Pressed Juicery. Their vanilla almond milk, made into a smooth frozen yogurt, is maybe the best thing I ate all weekend, even including the cake pops. </p>

<p>I literally want to eat this every day. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/cuHmOC0XapeIOLUDcurJnkAxjxQMJZZIO03y6_SUwV4g=w838-h1355-no" alt=""></p>

<p>How was your weekend? Do you have any holiday party plans? </p>

	<p>Warning. Animated gif heavy post. :)</p>

<p>It’s <a href="http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2014/12/11/bayareastorm-best-social-media-posts-capture-rain-wind-and-flooding/">pouring in the Bay Area</a> right now. Fortunately, I was able to make it to work without a canoe. Unfortunately, most of my coworkers would have needed some sort of water transportation to get here, and so, I’m nearly alone in the office (I count 15 people, usually there are ~200). </p>

<p>On the bright side, my work is super cool, and so today, we converted one of the office spaces into a skating rink. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-74mQhc9RIkY/VIojEOpknFI/AAAAAAAAQVY/t1EQkJkMyg0/w202-h358-no/skategif.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>I cannot contain my excitement. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-7YWJeohmnqw/VIoZ-EaH_zI/AAAAAAAAQUw/VJxC-hCzdwU/w1033-h775-no/IMG_5122.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>The “rink”.</p>

<p>So, first things first. It’s technically not “ice”. It’s a polymer, that they cover with vegetable oil, to make a slick skating surface. When you’re on it, it’s a lot less slippery than ice. I stepped on expecting to immediately bite it, but instead, I spent 10 minutes waddling around trying to figure out how hard I had to push to skate. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-m93QyKE7PAU/VIolvZgq5HI/AAAAAAAAQVs/pM2_DI11qUQ/w359-h202-no/skating2.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>My coworker figured out the mechanics a lot faster than me. </p>

<p>It was actually a lot more tiring than it looks, because it’s not ice, you have to use a lot of effort to get enough momentum to skate. </p>

<p>Between the fake snow, the pop-up ice rink, and the churros and mexican hot chocolate provided, we had a blast. At one point my team even had the whole rink to ourselves. It made me want to head out to a real ice rink this winter.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/g23oRQyY1tqctjRYnAwO-Na2mTJ9mZ-zVE9BxndYFoO0=w915-h1220-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Another image of me being excessively excited. When you live in an area that never feels like winter. (It’s a balmy 60 degrees with rain), it’s nice to have a little fake snow and ice to make it feel like the holidays. </p>

<p>How’s your workday (or home day) going? Are you good at skating? </p>

	<p>Woah, it’s almost Christmas. </p>

<p>Lately, I’ve been a blur of holiday shopping, project finishing, and Christmas partying this week (J and I have a holiday bash every night this week from Wednesday on. Since they’re all through work, it’s a lot of free delicious food and booze around. Yum, and also yikes!)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-_BZBuJgFq_s/VIf3a9BKLhI/AAAAAAAAQJk/lEyrZkgoGb4/s672-no/holidayparty.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>A friend and I from last year’s holiday party. It’s my one excuse to wear a gorgeous dress in San Francisco. I’ll definitely be snapping photos this year too. </p>

<p>But I wanted to step away from the December madness to bring you what I’m eating before all these festivities. So let’s get down to the <a href="http://peasandcrayons.com/2014/12/ate-wednesday-party-203.html">Wednesday eats</a>. </p>

<p>Breakfast is back with the best bagged eggs I’ve ever had. This is actually my most solid breakfast. I sometimes switch it up with the work buffet breakfast (usually a vegan pancake, eggs, and a slice of bacon.)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ZSGU7kRbZXw/VIfzYmjuOzI/AAAAAAAAQII/jW07GwjHfa0/w832-h672-no/IMG_5087.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Least sexy picture of the year award goes to my lunch. Lately, my goal has been to eat more vegetables. So the solution, and trick to this, is to always eat whatever my lunch is, over a salad. I have a bunch of friends who do this, and I just never caught on. However, it makes my pie-less chicken pot pie look rather unappetizing. Despite its looks, it was delicious.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/sswe8KyKllXY4ZRPFM8QXh4vnhoBfOByiW-hpjJXeAnW=w807-h672-no" alt=""></p>

<p>In this photo, I&#39;m straight up clawing my afternoon snack. I’ve been craving chocolate lately, and this chocolate covered coconut snack is amazing, and in small enough portions that I don’t eat an entire coconut’s worth. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/5bVQvp7q5p5osMWowky1lKUkBJ8S7cMBWO-VL-FM7OQg=s672-no" alt=""></p>

<p>I’m not much of a dinner person, but I met up with a friend for the vietnamese version of Chipotle. Which features yet another salad. Totally delicious. J and I have had this once before, and I literally can recommend everything I’ve had provided you like avocado, jalapeno, cilantro and pineapple. :)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/jakvuyWrhayTazahy7L1dtx1azaGvUDd3s5cIjE-ebC_=w896-h672-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Not a bad day! I think I’m due to eliminate some more sugar from my everyday eats, but otherwise I’m more satisfied with the food I’m sharing.</p>

<p>I definitely need to sit down and write some more things up. I recently got eyelash extensions (love), am decorating my teeny tiny apartment’s exterior for a contents (bring on the washi tape), and hit up a giant craft fair with a bunch of friends.</p>

<p>Are you prepared for the holidays? Any killer parties, or traditions I should start? I think I need to start a baking list for when I go back home. Anything (healthy, or less healthy) I should look into? :)</p>
