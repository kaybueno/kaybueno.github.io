	<h1><a href="/1-28-2015/WIAW-sick.html">What I ate Wednesday, when I was sick.</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		January 28, 2015
	</div>

	<p>I had a beautiful WIAW planned that was supposed to feature ingredients and plates that looked something like the picture above.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, when I woke up, I felt miserable. I could barely taste anything (such a waste), and my throat was scratchy and sore. And all my beautiful plans of nuts and other healthy fats were lost to ideas of soup and frozen drinks.</p>

<p>Being sick is hard enough, but trying to make decent food choices when you feel like your throat is made of sandpaper is quite the struggle. Between approximately 285 cups of tea, and a few shots of DayQuil, here’s <a href="//www.peasandcrayons.com">WIAW</a>.</p>

<p>I started the morning with a mango, orange, banana smoothie, and a bowl of apple cinnamon teff cereal. Having never had teff as a breakfast item, it&#39;s pretty close in taste to cream of wheat, or oatmeal. Its texture is much finer, almost like chia, or maybe even as fine as sand.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/UVSoTGXafWQwo_cmMrtKVUPipRdIgTVpqIGx63HfP7Ij=s716-no" alt=""><div class=caption></div></p>

<p>During lunch I made a break for the soup bar, after filling a bowl, I grabbed a plate of salad, sushi, and quinoa. Since you can&#39;t get Mom&#39;s chicken and dumpling (or noodle if you&#39;re a purist) when you&#39;re 2000 miles away, miso soup and some greens is about as good as it gets.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Odqw1ug7eRk/VMiaEPLgjUI/AAAAAAAAU4U/lcIl3ATrp9I/w1041-h605-no/15%2B-%2B2" alt=""></p>

<p>For snacks I headed to the juice bar, and grabbed a ginger and greens juice and some blueberry oatmeal bites. The bites didn’t really taste like much, but that may have been because I’m sick, or because the juice killed my pallette with a ginger bomb. I&#39;m kind of infatuated with my juice bar, the employees are always cheery, and mix the best drinks. I give them my ailment (DOMS, illness, 3pm fog), and they find me a juice. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Z2Gj4LM40HY/VMiaEN1gb6I/AAAAAAAAU34/OZKquYFxSTc/s716-no/15%2B-%2B4" alt=""></p>

<p>At the end of the night I grabbed Ramen with some friends. Hands down the best meal of the day. The spicyness made me forget I ever had sinuses, and the bowl came out so hot that it was basically a noodle sauna.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-xo8Bj1urVR8/VMiaEDTh69I/AAAAAAAAU3s/iIyWZk_Qcjo/w784-h716-no/15%2B-%2B5" alt=""></p>

<p>I&#39;ve got to tell you, I&#39;m so over being sick. When I was a kid, I remember having a light cold as being kind of fun. You got to stay home from school, watch TV, read, chill. Now, having a head cold just means I have to focus more to get my everything at work done, and I feel like I&#39;m wearing a perpetual nose plug, which makes eating, exercising, and talking so much fun. Sexy. I know.</p>

<p>How do you get over a cold? What&#39;s the best thing to eat when you&#39;re sick? :(</p>

	<h1><a href="/1-27-2015/no-excuses.html">Living #NoExcuses, when all I want to do is make excuses.</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		January 27, 2015
	</div>

	<p>Lately, I’ve been a part of Sweat Pink’s #NoExcuses challenge, and this week they asked us to “Share why YOU live with #NoExcuses”.</p>

<p>And when I received that email. I almost laughed. See, I definitely don’t live with #NoExcuses, I live with many excuses, loads of excuses. In fact, I’m probably on my way to being the queen of excuses. </p>

<p>And when it comes to exercising, I’m that person who throughout the day, is thinking of all the socially appropriate ways to evade my gym plans. But when the clock hits 6pm, I (usually!) still go work out. Because, while I live with a whole bunch of excuses, I make sure I eliminate them.</p>

<p>My most popular excuses and how I combat them:</p>

<h2>1. I don’t have my [article of workout wear], so I can’t workout today!</h2>

<p>This has been as pathetic as “I don’t have a hairband, guess I can’t go to the gym!”</p>

<p>To beat this excuse I use my filing cabinet, not for documents and files, but for spare gym clothes. Currently I have 5 shirts, 2 pairs of socks, a spare pair of shoes, a million hair ties and a water bottle.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Pr1zliR6qR_aFw0KLMn168BA263Bwdp4pvbXUeqZd5Cu=w777-h672-no" alt="">
<div class="caption">I know, my filing cabinet outfits do not match.</div>
<br></p>

<h2>2) I have a lot of work to do, and I’m too tired to workout.</h2>

<p>This is probably my most convincing excuse, because my job does take priority over fitness. (Otherwise I&#39;d do 8 hour days of vinyasa and soul cycle. But it doesn&#39;t pay the bills yo.) </p>

<p>And it might be a good excuse if there wasn&#39;t a gym onsite where I can always get a speedy workout in. Even if I&#39;m so brain dead I can&#39;t manage the gym, I can always take a 30 minute walk to think things over.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/1qJlC77bHMvcAHS3QyCX8din9KlLWW_1INf-Ss-bMlIH=s446-no" alt="">
<div class="caption">If every workoout looked like this, I swear, I&#39;d never skip.</div>
<br></p>

<h2>3) I can’t find time to work-out, or there&#39;s an event I can’t skip is going on when I usually head to the gym.</h2>

<p>I try to remind myself that fitness is a priority, and that many people wake up incredibly early in order to squeeze it in. (Like 5 a.m. early.) I can (and should) do that too.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/UE3f8YiJSUV41bOSZQnFiqs2h0vqQr4om3YFcmQE0fgt=w566-h672-no" alt=""><div class="caption">Besting my excuses gets me to the post gym selfie..</div></p>

<p>To me, living #NoExcuses isn&#39;t a matter of never having excuses, it&#39;s working on subtracting them until you get to #NoExcuses. </p>

<p>Excuses are part of my day to day, but moving past the excuses is what makes me proud, it&#39;s what makes me a competitor, and it&#39;s what makes me live &quot;#NoExcuses&quot;.</p>

<p>What are your excuses? And how do you get past them?</p>

	<h1><a href="/1-26-2015/weekend-eats.html">A weekend of eats!</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		January 26, 2015
	</div>

	<p>Thanks so much for all your sympathy over the crash! J has mostly received tough love from his manly roommates, and so it was nice to read all your lovely comments to him.</p>

<p>This weekend was the least vain weekend of all time, I managed to take almost no photos of myself. Partially because I was home, helping take care of J, and not out adventuring, and partially because I spent most of my weekend eating really delicious food.</p>

<p>Saturday night I went out with <a href="//www.almostgettingittogether.com">Cassie</a>, to Cha-ya. It’s a vegetarian/vegan Japanese restaurant that is so hole-in-the-wall, it doesn’t even have a website. Which may be the norm for non-chain restaurants in a lot of cities, but even the <a href="http://www.letsbefrankdogs.com/">grass fed hotdog stand</a> in my neighborhood has it’s own site. So not being on the internet here is kind of a big deal.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-xtckJoAjNhc/VMXtbycCoKI/AAAAAAAAUcY/pUCfBCa8eTo/s716-no/IMG_6355.JPG" alt=""><div class="caption">My suggestion? Order avocado everything.</div></p>

<p>Sunday night I met up with a friend to try out a Rhythm and Motion dance class. It was quite an adventure, primarily because I barely have rhythm, and mostly have motion. My biggest takeaway? I totally underestimated dancers, I was dripping in sweat by end.</p>

<p>I know I probably shouldn’t take on more things, but I really loved the class and might continue to go on Sunday nights. Can you pick up dance if you’re only doing it one night a week?</p>

<p>After class we met up with another friend and cooked dinner. Or really, to be fair, they cooked me dinner. It was phenomenal, and I apologize that my pictures don&#39;t do it any justice. I was too focused on enjoying the company and the candlelight to take good photos.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/CVE_vrsa_m7WGU8LJMyxwpKCCMqdbzhGaWKI8i5ca4xK=w958-h716-no" alt=""><div class="caption">Frisee salad with bacon, poached egg, and a bacon mustard vinaigrette.</div></p>

<p>We planned the dinner around my friend who is doing keto (with some serious success!) I was mostly impressed with how delicious keto is. Yum. Bacon. Egg. Cheese. Yum.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-6-ji7SCwjuA/VMXvNKLtZjI/AAAAAAAAUgg/zFMsWyMB96c/w955-h716-no/15%2B-%2B1" alt=""><div class="caption">Roasted chicken with a roasted cauliflower and broccolini done “mac &amp; cheese” style.</div></p>

<p>This is one of the first times I’ve been convinced you can cook better at home than in a restaurant. Everything was amazing.</p>

<p>The cutest picture of my weekend? A sleepy great dane I ran into on a walk I did. He, or maybe she, was chilling in the front of a designer eyewear shop. Makes me miss my mom’s dog. </p>

<p>How was your weekend? What should I do about the dance class? How often do you work out in a week?</p>

	<h1><a href="/1-22-2015/the-crash.html">The Crash</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		January 22, 2015
	</div>

	<p>On Monday, <a href="http://www.kaybueno.com/1-19-2015/MLK-day.html">I posted a sad photo of J from the emergency room</a>. This week, I’ve been in and out of urgent care, an emergency room, I’ve learned to splint toes, clean wounds, and how to nearly mummify someone in non-stick gauze.</p>

<p>But all of that pales in comparison to how the accident went down.</p>

<p>You see, J and I had plans to spend the weekend biking in Napa. Winter is the <a href="http://www.napavintners.com/harvest/life_cycle_of_a_grape.asp">pruning season</a> in Napa Valley, and so it means less tourists, cheaper hotels, and more open roads.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/JB4XVjDdXT7fWHAjDUd-tzYVws0QZWHdl7EA1quNka4R=w955-h716-no" alt=""><div class="caption">This is your boyfriend in Napa before he’s wrecked</div></p>

<p>We’ve done this route, or similar routes before. We planned for a 2 mile bike ride to the winery, and then about 25 more miles traversing the mountains nearby before we’d head back. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-f4UAxBTYovU/VL1oEb5NRqI/AAAAAAAAT_E/pcJd9aFMZKA/w794-h500-no/IMG_6207.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Though it took us awhile, we reached the top of the summit, and prepared for the fun part. Coasting downhill. J has always been more fearless than I am, so the rule is that he can go as fast as he wants, as long as he waits for me to catch up every so often. Yes, I am a baby who sometimes rides her brakes downhill.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Arg1sJDd-lI/VL1oS9w2ahI/AAAAAAAAUA8/Oy0VHiTGLDM/w955-h716-no/IMG_6217.JPG" alt="J biking"><div class="caption">We took some show-offy bike photos just minutes before eating it.</div></p>

<p>We started downhill, and after a few turns, I saw Jon waiting for me on the side of the road. I assumed he was just waiting for me to catch up, but as I got closer I noticed his bike handlebars were tangled around the frame, his face was pained, and his shirt had been completely shredded up and down the sides.</p>

<p>It turned out, he was taking the downhill at 40 mph, and didn&#39;t realize the next turn was so sharp. He started losing control, and grabbed the wrong brake, the rear brake, which made his bike fishtail. He thought he had control, but then he hit the gravel and went rolling. He told me, coincidentally, that right before he fell, he thought &quot;Wow, this is the most beautiful ride I&#39;ve ever done.&quot;</p>

<p>About a minute after the crash, a huge white SUV pulled up and asked if we were okay. He stopped for us and opened the trunk. It was full of boxes, first aid equipment, hazard clean up bags, knives, etc. I knew at this point we were either in really good hands. Or about to be murdered.</p>

<p>Turns out we were saved. The good Samaritan was a local Sheriff from the CSI division. He helped us clean up J, load our bikes into the car, and brought us to the ER. He had to duck out because he needed to get to a crime scene, but this guy pretty much saved us. If he hadn&#39;t stopped, I would have had to bike the remaining 12 miles to civilization and call an ambulance from there.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/rv4t9-sPGowcrBgexwJPczCxcFBTsqx95cOoxtRq4dnT=w955-h716-no" alt="J ER"></p>

<p>J got to the hospital, where he had many X-rays. Found out he broke his toe, and sprained his rib and shoulder. Received some serious pain killers, and was cleaned up even more. We made it out alive, and even got to eat BBQ after.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a cool story, and despite our accident, I definitely love, and want to continue biking in Napa. But for future hikes, bikes or just work outs, I think it&#39;s incredibly important to have an emergency plan. </p>

<p>There are about 100 ways this could have gone worse. If I was ahead of J. If no one stopped. If J hurt himself worse and needed immediate care. We didn&#39;t even have band-aids on us.</p>

<p>In the future, we&#39;ll definitely be carrying basic first aid supplies, I&#39;m making both of us take our phones, and we&#39;ll have to have a plan of action for getting lost.</p>

<p>What&#39;s the craziest thing that&#39;s happened to you lately? Do you have plans in case of emergencies?</p>
