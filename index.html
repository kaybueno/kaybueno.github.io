	<p>It’s one of those Mondays, where I can’t believe it’s Monday already. I think it has a little something to do with the fact that I spent my entire weekend here:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-0gC_Qyb39hc/VLN6g-9adpI/AAAAAAAATXc/co52EKkcLns/w864-h531-no/IMG_6019.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Time flies a lot faster on a mountain.</p>

<p>J and I spent the weekend in Tahoe with fifteen of our friends. We rented a cabin, bought an unwieldy amount of food from Costco, and skied our hearts out. J, my ever patient boyfriend and ex-ski-instructor, spent most of his time trying to teach me how to come down a mountain without dying. </p>

<p>I mostly succeeded.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Oh_vdfMVi6c/VLHAK2kIqxI/AAAAAAAATXs/pAiXHmIMNS4/w864-h648-no/IMG_6012.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>It was my second time skiing. Even though I didn’t make it to the blue runs, (in fact, I kind of freaked out about the one I did), I had a blast. </p>

<p>While I think taking lessons from someone close to you can be a disaster, I learned really well from J, and didn’t kill him (neither death by ski crash, nor death from over critiquing my form). Which is pretty much a relationship win in my book.</p>

<p>Even with 15 people, the cabin went smoothly, we didn’t trash the place, get too drunk, and we didn’t cook all our breakfast bacon at 3 am. Which the group took as a positive sign we’re getting older. We all returned home safely, and to the most beautiful sunset I’ve seen ever.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Pj2BErvuo8c/VLN68DeKXAI/AAAAAAAATXU/4pXfZZjVViE/w863-h358-no/IMG_6039.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Today, I’m pretty much sore everywhere, and I feel really energized. Which is a pretty great excuse to spend a weekend doing something new. I’ll definitely be skiing again soon. :)</p>

<p>How was your weekend?   </p>

	<p>This whole week I’ve felt under the weather. I’m pretty sure this is what happens when you start feeding your body actual nutrients after a two week diet of sugar and alcohol. </p>

<p>I’ve been taking it easy, a lot of my coworkers have been out sick, and I&#39;d hate to make it worse. But my body really did me in this time, because while I was chilling at home in a shark onesie, trying to figure out what my stomach would consider eating.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-popriW-o1rA/VH6hu6tBwzI/AAAAAAAATGw/KcQDZigrIpQ/w537-h716-no/IMG_5015.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>My boyfriend was meeting Chris Hemsworth (who he keeps adorably referring to as Liam.) I got this Snapchat as I was laying on the couch, wishing I could surgically remove my intestines.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/NqGzdOomSihcELoqn6MQiptlK2A76QbaXMU5n4aA2V1U=w403-h715-no" alt=""></p>

<p>I’m feeling better today, but that’s not the point! I could have been there if it wasn&#39;t for my scumbag stomach. :)</p>

<p>I saw this candle on someone’s blog this week (sorry I forgot who, my memory is terrible). And because I’m an impulsive child, I bought it Thursday night. </p>

<p>Big surprise. It smells like cotton candy, or just straight up sugar, or some saccharine sweet smell you know immediately. And while it’s not the candle I’ll use to seduce my boyfriend into a romantic night (unless your boyfriend loves candy, then this IS your candle), it’s a fun scent to have burning.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/WsK-aKJupQyVZ-mLUWnAQTNBMrcdR3EtpWQYopftPZAt=w781-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>And while I’m not usually a food candle person, I’m glad I grabbed this baby at Target. For 10 dollars we can make my house smell like all the best parts of a carnival. :)</p>

<p>Finally, I took this picture covertly at work of our fruit situation. Is it just me, or does fruit seem more legit when it still has the leaves on it? I keep picking the mandarins that look like they’re still growing on a tree somewhere.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/u_tS1bNtXP4S3y8B1bQmBr5NSX4SoAu3B-QIxoG_xcD6=w1041-h713-no" alt=""></p>

<p>I hoard like 3 of those puppies a day. Don’t judge.</p>

<p>Anyhow! I&#39;m off skiing this weekend. This is the second time in my life ever, and J&#39;s like 3409803945 time. He was an instructor for a brief period of time, so I try to use him for lessons to save money. :)</p>

<p>What are you up to this weekend?</p>

	<p>Two years ago. I didn’t have any hobbies. None. Not because I was busy, or because I had just moved, but because I couldn’t stomach the fact that I might look dumb doing something. </p>

<p>I was incredibly insecure. I thought that I needed to look effortless, and attractive, and cool, all the time. And that meant not taking on anything new, because I wasn&#39;t sure I could do it perfectly. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/8IbkLAUgzB56G4c9PAqYeZOxeBnXrUFXAdN-UzBjFVIN=w794-h706-no" alt="dranks with the roomies"></p>

<p>(This is probably what I thought cool looked like.)</p>

<p>In the event I did end up out of my comfort zone, I wasn’t good at it, I’d just quit. I know, real winning attitude there. It was terrible for me, and probably worse for the people I was around. </p>

<p>And I might not have ever really tried anything if I didn’t accidentally stumble upon a hobby I loved.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Z8yQO85-AX8/VK4VSw64e0I/AAAAAAAATA0/EwLzC8jKEi8/w960-h637-no/trapeze1.jpg" alt="trapeze"></p>

<p>Flying trapeze. </p>

<p>I finally wanted to be good at something so badly, I was willing to be bad at it to do so. Flying trapeze was the greatest high (literally) I had ever had, and I was addicted. I was also terrible. I&#39;m inflexible, and tall, and altogether difficult person to catch. But it was amazing. And being bad at trapeze was the best thing that happened to me.</p>

<p>I figured, once I was a total novice at one thing. Why not make a fool of myself doing all the things I wished I could do?</p>

<p>So I started running. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/q250TjR-a9ZNhekEpN1N6TxDN3MUUNFaQ__vIcC4hwqA=w955-h716-no" alt="running"></p>

<p>And yoga.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/KIMoLaHs688VGrCvkLkCL9w6CLFj_7Sayvbhyb3OWGV7=w932-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>Today. Am I the best at any of these things? </p>

<p>Not even close. I run 9-10 minute miles, I&#39;m just now able to touch the floor in a forward fold, and I&#39;m still the slowest trapeze student to pick up new tricks. I read the most amazing blogs of friends who are spin instructors, serious yogis, competitive runners, and I think &quot;Oh god, what am I doing here?&quot;</p>

<p>But even as an inflexible, kind of slow student, I&#39;m the happiest me I&#39;ve ever been. I&#39;ve stopped comparing myself to others. I&#39;m much better at celebrating achievements, and I let myself try anything.</p>

<p>With the New Year rolling around, and goals being on everyone&#39;s mind, I want to remind you that you are more than the things you&#39;re good at, and it&#39;s worth trying anything you want to do even if you fail fantastically at it. I would have never run a half, or swung tricks out of lines if I didn&#39;t allow myself to be bad at things first.</p>

<p>In the immortal words of the cartoon show Adventure Time:</p>

<p>“Dude, suckin’ at something is the first step to being sorta good at something”.</p>

<p>What do you suck at?</p>

	<p>Guys. I don’t want to jinx it. But, the new year has me motivated. Real motivated. Like, spend-two-hours-power-cleaning-your-apartment-when-you-get-home-from-work motivated. </p>

<p>And it’s been spilling over evvvverywhere. One of the things I knew I needed to rock in January was my eating habits, especially important after I consumed no less than 23495 Christmas cookies while home last week.</p>

<p>So I’m trying to rock way more vegetables, way less sugar, and just a generally healthier eating schedule. So welcome to my favorite day of the week, <a href="http://peasandcrayons.com/2015/01/ate-wednesday-207.html">WIAW</a>.</p>

<p>Breakfast is standard. Greek yogurt, so much coffee, and asian pears.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-34vH2atyNig/VKwwq9zXEEI/AAAAAAAAS6U/V1WQzZxeQgg/w915-h912-no/IMG_5924.JPG" alt="Breakfast"></p>

<p>Welcome to “put your lunch over a salad” salad. One of my good friends in Chicago used to be a chef in a fancy Vegas restaurant, and when I told him about this food strategy, he threatened to disown me. Apparently, greens don’t automatically pair well with “everything”.</p>

<p>So this is shredded pork, guacamole, jalapenos, pico de gallo, over a salad. I couldn’t decide between the salsa roja, or the yogurt based salsa demente, so I used both. :)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ChUEd77bnX0/VKxjoXi4s7I/AAAAAAAAS9o/zDJxTCxy-VM/w915-h708-no/IMG_5928.JPG" alt="Lunch"></p>

<p>Snack was an old favorite. Popcorn, which I grabbed a handful or two and put into a vintage Santa mug. I’d like to say it’s because I still have a lot of Christmas spirit, but really it’s because I’m too lazy to put away my decorations.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-b6qoUn8hyRM/VKxkINWrasI/AAAAAAAAS9w/WRMWTLOuAac/w915-h985-no/IMG_5937.JPG" alt="Popcorn"></p>

<p>This is the post where you find out my hands are literally like paddles, or giant oven mitts. But I grabbed a handful of nuts. Best part? NO PEANUTS. I hate nut mixes that are dominated by peanuts. Put them in a nut butter, great. Put them in a trail mix and I’m over it. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-fQwpnx64LRk/VKx3W5v5wgI/AAAAAAAAS-s/5FVfJcmwtLc/w915-h1029-no/IMG_5939.JPG" alt="Nuts"></p>

<p>I had a grand total of three of these parmesan crisps (15 is a serving). But they were so delicious and satiating that I needed to include them. So enjoy the speckled brown that is my dirt floor, and do yourself a favor (if you like dairy) and get on these, or make them.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/J30cWAq9evBae1McsNtRkW3QJhxAGwzlcf1SHJ7kA78l=w915-h1046-no" alt="Parm Crisps"></p>

<p>Usually, I’m not much for dinner. But I’m trying to rectify that, and realize that popcorn is not a vegetable. So here’s salad part two. I try to relish in the fact that by eating this salad I’m now ahead of <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/wk/mm5935.pdf">75% of Americans in vegetable eating</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ZFOJvOFFc5Nhj83TxRByp9k-nWfMsJHfEJ-Gd7Eusf-d=w728-h716-no" alt="Dinner Salad"></p>

<p>Last, unrelated little tidbit. Today is the best Wednesday regardless of what I ate because it’s my mom’s birthday! Even though I hopefully already texted and called her, I want to wish her a third, or fourth Happy Birthday. </p>

<p>She’s not only had to put up with me for over 20 years, but she’s down for anything, we’ve done flying trapeze, surfed, and this year we’re running Seawheeze together.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-wk05N2A9x-w/VKzTfe5LccI/AAAAAAAATAQ/3BURMU1W6KM/w960-h640-no/momsurf.jpg" alt="Mom surfing"></p>

<p>So Happy Birthday Madre!</p>

<p>How’s your Wednesday going? </p>
