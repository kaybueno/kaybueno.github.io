	<h1><a href="/2-10-2015/making-big-purchases.html">Making big purchases.</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		February 10, 2015
	</div>

	<p>I won’t lie, I’m someone who often employs retail therapy to make myself feel better. I love buying a box of new granola bars, or finding a cute candle or buying a new subscription box on an impulse. And, while I have a general budget, I do let myself roam pretty freely with small purchases. If I see something cute on etsy under 50 dollars, chances are, I’ll eventually buy it.</p>

<p>But when it comes to big purchases, for some reason it seems much more serious to me. I could buy ten, $10 products in a week, but one pair of $98 lululemon yoga pants makes me reconsider. Because of this, it can take me weeks to finally pull the trigger on expensive purchases.</p>

<p>When I look back to my time in San Francisco. There are two major purchases I’ve made, and today I made another. I wanted to look back and see if they were worth the weeks of deliberation I put myself through.</p>

<p>The first big ticket item I bought was my bike. J and I actually bought our bikes together. We had dreams of long scenic rides on the weekends, and fast trips throughout the city. We agonized over whether we should go road, mountain, or hybrid. We eventually both bought road bikes and it was like buying my first car all over again.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-d77wl8Ge6mg/VL1q1UftRwI/AAAAAAAAUDM/iIzCFPSZTb8/w955-h716-no/IMG_6251.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Fortunately, in terms of miles, the bikes have paid themselves off easily. I don’t own a car, and so I can either, bike, walk, or take an uber into work. Self powering my commute saves me ~12 dollars a day, and makes me more awake, alert, and happy. I love my Cannondale, and even after trying a more comfortable commuter bike, still want to stick with my baby.</p>

<p>The next year, my big purchase was my Canon EOS 7D. I had been wanting to take better pictures, and blog better pictures for awhile. I have quite a few friends who do photo walks, and always have gorgeous photos they’ve edited on Facebook. I researched for awhile to find an intermediate camera, and finally bit the bullet and bought this one.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-mO8AEUfx460/U-Kfv1qCDTI/AAAAAAAAD84/jVfuJE-dzIk/w477-h716-no/IMG_1502.PNG" alt=""><div class="caption">The only photo I took of the camera.</div></p>

<p>It takes amazing pictures, even on auto. The first day it came in J and I did a pretty serious unboxing and started taking pictures around the house. It was like Christmas Day.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-_mq-pF2JxfI/U3BPIPBSgMI/AAAAAAAAATw/jQliA7AIlGc/w477-h716-no/IMG_0003.JPG" alt=""><div class="caption">One of the first photos I took with the 7D.</div></p>

<p>However, I feel a little guilty on this one. I still don’t know how to really use my camera. And when J leaves for a month of work trips, I plan on really improving this area so that I can better utilize this baby.</p>

<p>Which brings me to today. I had a Fitbit Force for the past year, and it finally broke from all the love and miles I put on it. In the past few weeks, I’ve been surprised at how much I missed step tracking, as a traditional office worker, it’s a really strong barometer for how my activity levels have been. </p>

<p>After a lot of consideration. I purchased the <a href="https://www.fitbit.com/surge">Fitbit Surge</a>. I’m super excited about the new features, but it’s definitely taken me almost a month to get on board with buying it. It’s being delivered today, so I’ll let you know how I like it.</p>

<p>What’s the last big purchase you made? Do you think a lot of about big purchases, or small ones?</p>

	<h1><a href="/2-9-2015/food-wine-friends.html">A weekend of food, wine, and friends.</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		February 9, 2015
	</div>

	<p>This weekend, to embrace the storms in SF, J went up to Tahoe in hopes of good snow, and I stayed in the city to meet <a href="http://nuttyforlife.com/">Angela</a>, who was in visiting <a href="//www.almostgettingittogether.com">Cassie</a>. </p>

<p>While I enjoy time with J, there’s something refreshing about spending a weekend with people who want to take pictures of everything, always order a salad, and actually enjoy beets. </p>

<p>I met up with Cass and Ange at <a href="http://kinkhao.com/">Kin Khao</a>, a super cute Thai place downtown. Turns out it’s on the <a href="http://www.michelintravel.com/selections/2015-san-francisco-michelin-selections/">Michelin Recommended list</a> (always a great way to find restaurants), and it definitely lived up to its recommendation. The food was amazing, the curry was potent, and the vegetables speak for themselves.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-jH7AcjnA6W0/VNcBfwa7vQI/AAAAAAAAWCI/yKwJg6f4JeI/w537-h716-no/15%2B-%2B8" alt=""><div class="caption">I could live on Kin Khao’s brussel sprouts.</div></p>

<p>The next morning we were off to Napa. We hit up <a href="http://www.scribewinery.com/">Scribe</a>, an artisinal winery and vineyard in Sonoma, which is probably my new favorite winery of all time. If you go, you’ll fall in love with the land, the wine, and your sommelier. I know we did.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-A_4FxzUOuVU/VNjoMhjR3GI/AAAAAAAAWGA/ezjitnSQS3s/w955-h716-no/15%2B-%2B5" alt=""><div class="caption">A lot of the day looked like this.</div></p>

<p>The weather behaved and we ended up having a beautiful sunny morning at Scribe. Drinking in both the view, and the varietals, there’s so much to talk about that I have to save Scribe for it’s own post. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/UutUv1tteHVC5G9HtwWdEOBfNVafJ65bnbBtLYEIfu22=w1041-h630-no" alt="Girls at Scribe"></p>

<p>Everything on Saturday was really low key, so no one was bothered as I climbed on a bench to snap a quick photo.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-tDU3-YOL3N4/VNbyh1xEFGI/AAAAAAAAVow/-p8TXkCSKsA/w955-h716-no/IMG_6692.JPG" alt=""><div class="caption">The photo.</div></p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-fGBi3GZJBhU/VNjoMlEwAoI/AAAAAAAAWFo/ST14Znoo9iU/w537-h716-no/15%2B-%2B3" alt=""><div class="caption">The photographer.</div></p>

<p>After Scribe we hit up <a href="https://www.mummnapa.com/">Mumm</a>, known for their sparkling wine, we were excited to get our bubbly on.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/zqPzrP1YM95wtjKEFquJdL1Uu9hcYztLdI7ZM5uWVgnQ=w982-h716-no" alt=""></p>

<p>But after the beautiful scenery, our personable host, and the phenomenal wine at Scribe, it was hard to enjoy the cookie cutter feel of Mumm. When we heard the table next to us get the same specials speech, it felt a little dry.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-2NLsiiIoOao/VNcBfw_1OhI/AAAAAAAAWBU/ZbpUlpFOJ1o/w537-h716-no/15%2B-%2B17" alt=""></p>

<p>At least the glasses were beautiful, and fun to drink.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-58bncEjsA64/VNjoMigVM2I/AAAAAAAAWFw/Dmfr317lZ-A/w537-h716-no/15%2B-%2B4" alt=""><div class="caption">This is the photo you take after your awkward server cards you.</div></p>

<p>We went with the staff favorites tasting. While I wanted to love the sparkling pinot noir. My favorite was the DVX 2009, (second from the left).</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ADODGNNkI10/VNcBf01N0cI/AAAAAAAAWCY/1jt6UWRJFI4/w995-h716-no/15%2B-%2B16" alt=""></p>

<p>We left and grabbed the most delicious food (and another 3 cups of coffee) at <a href="http://www.longmeadowranch.com/Farmstead/Restaurant">Farmstead</a> in Napa. While I neglected to take pictures, I strongly recommend it. The beets, the salad, and the fish were off the charts.</p>

<p>On Sunday we headed to Palo Alto to grab Pressed Juicery’s Freeze. Basically, froyo made of their juice flavors. It’s one of those foods I would eat daily if it were in the city, primarily because the vanilla almond milk freeze is 40 calories. Yum.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/G4XaunxMch3WwGnfhHqHAa0pAY5Q10zh-vw4qS9cZN79=w771-h716-no" alt=""><div class="caption">The usual. Vanilla almond milk, with blueberries, coconut and almond butter.</div></p>

<p>All in all. A pretty killer weekend. </p>

<p>How was your weekend? Have you been to Napa yet?</p>

	<p>Thanks to Jury Duty yesterday, J and I were able to play around in the city after my case was released.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-syIKbUei2UE/VNLa4nTiYmI/AAAAAAAAVUU/r1ZcT6Ds2F0/w955-h716-no/IMG_6581.JPG" alt=""><div class="caption">This was a fountain before the drought.</div></p>

<p>Despite living in the city, I don&#39;t actually work in the city most days. So I rarely catch San Francisco while it&#39;s still light out during the week.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-DesR7WfMIrw/VNLYyLeEuHI/AAAAAAAAVTA/6qn9fU8PJPY/w955-h716-no/IMG_6574.JPG" alt=""><div class="caption">The less famous bridge in San Francisco.</div></p>

<p>Lately, I&#39;ve felt like I have a lot to do, and so it was nice to have a government imposed day off, but I&#39;m glad my case didn&#39;t end up going to trial. I don&#39;t think I could survive 2-3 weeks of a court case.</p>

<p>How&#39;s your week going? If you had a day off of work, where would you go?</p>

	<h1><a href="/2-4-2015/paleo-WIAW.html">Paleo/Primal Inspired WIAW</a></h1>
	
	<div class="date">
		February 4, 2015
	</div>

	<p>A few weeks ago, I challenged myself to explore different diets on <a href="http://peasandcrayons.com/2015/02/ate-wednesday-211-feed-seymour.html">WIAW</a>. One of the main reasons I wanted to take on more diverse eating styles for WIAW, was to shake up my current routine. Trying <a href="http://www.kaybueno.com/1-21-2015/vegan-WIAW.html">vegan</a> was great, but it was already an eating style I was relatively comfortable with, and one that my current lifestyle and workplace made easy.</p>

<p>This week I was inspired by the Paleo/Primal/Keto diets out there. Now. I say inspired because I think it’s naive to think I can read about a way of eating, emulate it for a day, and really understand the workings. If you follow <a href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/">Mark’s Daily Apple</a>, <a href="http://robbwolf.com/">Robb Wolf</a>, or even <a href="http://paleomg.com/">PaleOMG</a>, you’re going to get a much more developed view of these diets. For me, I just wanted to shuck routine, and maybe even find a new eating style I was better suited to.</p>

<p>I had to prep a lot for this week, and I didn’t even finish all the prep I wanted to. I took a lot of inspiration from <a href="https://ieatirunblog.wordpress.com/2014/08/04/recipe-nut-bombs-primal-fruit-parfait/">IEatIRun</a>.</p>

<p>I started with a twist on her nut bombs. (I was out of almonds). Which are pretty similar to most of the energy bites out there. Even post paleo experimenting, I’ve been eating these on a regular basis. Enough to have made them twice now. </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-UEIErzYhiMc/VMcuid51EXI/AAAAAAAAUyI/6Fkwwwzg7J8/w1041-h702-no/IMG_6432.JPG" alt="snack prep"></p>

<p>Breakfast was also an IEatIRun rip off. I made a coconut cream parfait, with crumbled nut bombs, a few sliced strawberries and coconut cream from <a href="http://cookeatpaleo.com/how-to-make-coconut-whipped-cream/">this recipe</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/QzlnUACF12QKFkfgG_a_6lzSps2TQc4E4rOn5VR0tgdB=w868-h716-no" alt="breakfast"></p>

<p>For lunch I was stuck with what was at work. When consulting with a friend who eats Paleo at the same company, he told me his biggest issue was finding food that wasn’t cooked in canola oil. Fortunately, I got lucky with olive oil ahi tuna, a salad, and zucchini dressed in an avocado, citrus, and olive oil dressing.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-TmTTKcy45to/VNG1RjQA9RI/AAAAAAAAVP0/s9pe8iac0OI/w962-h716-no/15%2B-%2B4" alt="lunch"></p>

<p>I was swamped with work until dinner, but I had brought nut bombs in case I couldn’t find a reasonable snack. I popped one before and Iyengar yoga class. (A good stretch, but not my beloved Vinyasa.)</p>

<p>For dinner, I grabbed a pesto chicken breast, smothered it in a chipotle salsa, and had a side salad and guacamole. I don’t know why I don’t eat this dinner more often...</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/jE1J_zJ2v5Hhtx2BmqBuuiS4EE8hXpRbQHhk7fPF1sUi=w964-h716-no" alt="dinner"></p>

<p>Overall, this was definitely a blast, and definitely out of my usual element for food choices. I had to be a little more discerning. I&#39;d love to up my paleo trend to a week, or a month, but I have a few consistent meals that don&#39;t really fit right now. So I&#39;ll have to get to planning.</p>

<p>Do you eat paleo? Have you ever tried it?</p>
