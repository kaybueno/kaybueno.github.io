	<h1><a href="">A weekend of eats!</a></h1>

	<p>Thanks so much for all your sympathy over the crash! J has mostly received tough love from his manly roommates, and so it was nice to read all your lovely comments to him.</p>

<p>This weekend was the least vain weekend of all time, I managed to take almost no photos of myself. Partially because I was home, helping take care of J, and not out adventuring, and partially because I spent most of my weekend eating really delicious food.</p>

<p>Saturday night I went out with <a href="www.almostgettingittogether.com">Cassie</a>, to Cha-ya. It’s a vegetarian/vegan Japanese restaurant that is so hole-in-the-wall, it doesn’t even have a website. Which may be the norm for non-chain restaurants in a lot of cities, but even the <a href="http://www.letsbefrankdogs.com/">grass fed hotdog stand</a> in my neighborhood has it’s own site. So not being on the internet here is kind of a big deal.</p>

<p>Sunday night I met up with a friend to try out a Rhythm and Motion dance class. It was quite an adventure, primarily because I barely have rhythm, and mostly have motion. My biggest takeaway? I totally underestimated dancers, I was dripping in sweat by end.</p>

<p>I know I probably shouldn’t take on more things, but I really loved the class and might continue to go on Sunday nights. Can you pick up dance if you’re only doing it one night a week?</p>

<p>After class we met up with another friend and cooked dinner. Or really, to be fair, they cooked me dinner. It was phenomenal, and I apologize that my pictures don&#39;t do it any justice. I was too focused on enjoying the company and the candlelight to take good photos.</p>

<p>We planned the dinner around my friend who is doing keto (with some serious success!) I was mostly impressed with how delicious keto is. Yum. Bacon. Egg. Cheese. Yum.</p>

<p>This is one of the first times I’ve been convinced you can cook better at home than in a restaurant. Everything was amazing.</p>

<p>The cutest picture of my weekend? A sleepy great dane I ran into on a walk I did. He, or maybe she, was chilling in the front of a designer eyewear shop. Makes me miss my mom’s dog. </p>

<p>How was your weekend? What should I do about the dance class? How often do you work out in a week?</p>
